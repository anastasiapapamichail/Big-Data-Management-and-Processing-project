Running a select query to check for a duplicate processing that result and then inserting if successful will be considerably slower than inserting and handling an occasional error. If its raising an exception then that will be a bit slower since exception handling is slow in most languages but handling a exception will be many times faster than an SQL query in any language. </p> <p>As Assaf said there is also usually a way to explicitly handle duplicates so you might be able to avoid the error altogether. This would increase performance further and allow you to be explicit that you're handling duplicates in a particular way.</p> <p>Whether or not to use stored procedures is up to you - it can help with performance at the expense of putting more logic in your database.

In watching the CPU utilization when debugging in chrome I would see it use up to as much at 40% of all 4 cores of my processor. I tried everything to no avail. Finally I tried making the browser window of the page I was debugging as small as I could without losing any of the required view and miraculously it solved the problem. So now I keep my debugger window popped out in a separate window and make the window of the page I am debugging as small as I can and my debugging experience is very fast again.

This <a href= http://docstore.mik.ua/orelly/perl/cookbook/ch04_09.htm rel= nofollow >link</a> gives a very good treatment of the problem in general.</p> <p>In your case the set is nothing but the list of values from each file. The logic is if a certain value was present in both files then $hash{matchline} == 2 because the value will be incremented in both the while loops. However if the line was present in only one of the files the value of $hash{matchline} == 1 since only one while loop will increment the value and not the other.</p> <p>Also Lajos Veres raises a very important point: if a certain word say Tom is present twice in the same file then the algorithm will fail.

The visualization is just too complex to do a simple mapping from data to SVG (and that's what D3.js is mainly for: generating DOM (documents) from Data through concise mappings).</p> <p>You can work around those limitations by introducing more logic in between so that data is not directly being displayed but rather a model is being created some calculations are being done and then the result is transformed to SVG by D3. This is what <a href= https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3 rel= nofollow >dagre</a> is trying to do and it works rather well. </p> <p>However your graph has some special constraints that are currently not supported by simpler implementations of the layout algorithm: In the last layer you get a fork-like rendering. In the decision -layer you assign constraints to the edges so that they leave at the left and right of the nodes you also constrain the decision nodes to be on the same layer.</p> <p>All of this information is not visible in the graph structure itself. Therefor you need to annotate that information into your model and tell the layout algorithm to honor these constraints.

24671111,,<p>There are several concerns in your code but let me try to wrap them up: </p> <h2>Controller</h2> <p>How is the controller called? As you paginate through stores I assume it is the <code>StoresController</code>. In <em>Rails Way</em> we would expect a <code>StoresController</code> to perform actions on <code>Stores</code> models. </p> <p>Also in a more <em>RESTful</em> way you would probably not define a function <code>near</code> but rather a function <code>index</code> which lists all <code>Stores</code> and this list can be sorted by providing the <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> params.</p> <h2>Models</h2> <p>It is unclear to me why you do <code>Store.find_by_id(bank[ id ])</code>. In normal scenarios such a call makes no sense as a <code>bank_id</code> only <em>identifies</em> a <code>Bank</code> and not a <code>Store</code>. So I assume you are looking for some relations between <code>Bank</code> and <code>Store</code> model which you would achieve by adding a <code>bank_id</code> field to your <code>stores</code> Table and define the <code>Store</code> model as: </p> <pre><code>class Store &lt; ActiveRecord:Base belongs_to :bank end </code></pre> <h2>Query</h2> <p>As previous answeres claimed you would better go with so called <em>scopes</em> to put your query into the model and not the controller. But for your specific usecase I would recommend to have a look at the <a href= https://github.com/geokit/geokit-rails rel= nofollow >geokit-rails gem</a> which would allow you to do something like:</p> <pre><code>Store.by_distance(origin: [params[:lat]params[:lng]]) </code></pre> <p>In order to use it you have to define your <code>Store</code> model to <code>acts_as_mappable</code> like this:</p> <pre><code>class Store &lt; ActiveRecord:Base acts_as_mappable :through =&gt; :bank end </code></pre> <p>And of course you need the <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> fields defined in your <code>banks</code> table.</p> <p>(Unfortunately the README of the geokit-rails gem is way out of date so you have to fiddle a bit to get it right)</p> <h2>pagination</h2> <p>I think it is an error to write </p> <p>@user = @stores.paginate(:page => params[:page] :per_page => 10 )</p> <p>With above query code you should instead write</p> <p>@stores = Store.by_distance(origin: [params[:lat]params[:lng]]).paginate(page: params[:page] per_page: 10)</p> <h2>Error handling</h2> <p>It is unlikely that you will get an ActiveRecord::NotFound Exception as these are usually only thrown when you use <code>find</code>-lookups on specific <code>id</code>. When you want to throw such an exception you would to something like:</p> <pre><code>raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound if @stores.empty? </code></pre> <p>at the bottom of your method.</p>,,,0,,7/10/2014 7:49:51,,7/10/2014 7:49:51,,,,,999069,24670142,2,1,,

For example the following is valid Java.</p> <pre><code>try { throw new IllegalArgumentException(); } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println( boom ); } </code></pre> <p>So in your action/controller you can have a try-catch block around the logic where the Hibernate call is made.

21841062,,<p>This depends on almost about anything and you don't say much about your server side.</p> <p>But you must balance on what you compute before and what you compute now. The before takes space and saves time the now takes time and saves space. Do you have fast I/O (hdd/ssd/raid X) ? Do you have much space? Do you have powerful cpus? Does your server handle great bandwith? Why each tile should have <strong>1000</strong> records? What are the most popular zoom levels?</p> <p>First of all you must start from somewhere. Your tiniest data is the minute. So you must have details about minutes. This releaves you from holding miliseconds. From my experience a file with a range of id's is essential like a <code>23211239-23242175.csv</code> file. So that tile is your start. The id I got is the <code>miliseconds/1000/60</code> to become minutes. I see your data has time-range and that is a small problem. Every record should fill entirely into your timeframe it's like you should care only about <code>timeEnd</code> and put the record in that time-frame.</p> <p>To have good I/O check your file to be close to a multiple of the cluster size of your disks. For windows I think it is <strong>4kb</strong>. The cluster size is the size that is brought back by the disk in one I/O let's say you have 2 csv's that are <strong>6kb</strong> each. It would require 2 I/O's to bring each file to the memory so you got <strong>4 I/O's</strong> to bring <strong>2x6Kb</strong> files. But if you split these into 3 of 4kb each it would require <strong>3 I/O's</strong> to load them into memory. So check if these tiles are really close to cluster size.</p> <p>See if you can get rid of some fields like <code>timeStarttimeEndtimeDuration</code> because your filename will describe these fields. Try to precompute as much data as you can to save proccessing time. From your details on zoom's levels each level is computed by the previous level. Try to create subfolders that go through the next levels. You don't have to compute every zoom level try to skip some it will save space. Then upon requests you will find what users are most asking for and create it if it does not exist. Have folders like:</p> <pre><code>Path/1m/xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx.csv Path/30m/xxxxxxx-xxxxxx.csv Path/6h/xxxxx-xxxxx.csv Path/w/xx-xx.csv </code></pre> <p>Be sure you only have the <strong>1 minute</strong> file at start and then create the others. I bet that when you zoom into a level like for <strong>2014</strong> it will show <strong>2014's</strong> months. So it is like you need at most X results for each chart. So maybe your tiles won't have the same lenth at each zoom level/folder. It depends on what they describe. Then it will be easy for you to find anything just check the range the file describes and return it. Popular resolutions can be cached into memory for a period of time to make even faster the output proccess.</p> <p>On the client side you should try to keep as much data as you can. Don't ask server for data that you have previously got again. The problem with RAM caching files is that the file can be outdated so be careful. If you watch results of past year (year is said because it is the most generic resolution level in this application) you should know that newcomers won't affect these old fields so you can cache them safely.</p> <p>This problem does not lie only on client side programming.

6230021,,<p>This is how I did it (and a brief overview of how android stack (running on vbox) works).</p> <p>An Android app having GPS functionality registers some callbacks with the underlying implementation of user mode shared lib (typically libgps.so or libhardware_legacy.so) using JNI interfaces (as exported in <code>frameworks/base/core/jni/android_location_GpsLocationProvider.cpp</code>)</p> <p>These registered callbacks are responsible for notifying GPS fix (or change in gps location) to the app.</p> <p>Here is a simple image demonstrating call flow from <code>Android -&gt; VBox -&gt; Windows</code></p> <p><img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/vuQq6.png alt= enter image description here ></p> <p>Now to complete this flow following steps were required:</p> <ol> <li><p>I created my own <code>libgps.so</code> exporting the function <code>gps_get_interface</code> (declared in <code>gps.h</code>) which is used by JNI interface. An app with gps support gets the latest coordinates returned from this libgps.so which is actually loaded dynamically by the GpsLocationProvider service.</p></li> <li><p>Create one more shared object using Vbox headers and containing routines to connect disconnect and send function request to the <code>host service</code> running in host OS. These are simple ioctl calls with pre-defined ioctl-numbers (eg: VBOX_GUEST_IOCTL_HGCM_CONNECT etc).</p></li> <li><p>Create a host service (which actually is a DLL loaded by <code>VBox Host Service</code>) with can handle the parameters passed from HGCM calls and return the required data in a format that the shared object created in step 2 understands.</p></li> <li><p>Now to send any fake/dummy location back to an app running inside <code>Android VM</code> you just need to notify the <code>host service</code> and the rest is communicated back to <code>VBox Additions</code> -> <code>libgps.so</code> -> <code>GpsLocationProvider service</code> -> and finally to the <code>App with GPS Support</code>.</p></li> </ol> <p>Hope this will help some one trying some thing similar or help some one understanding how android stack works.</p> <p>NOTE: Compiling the hgcm code and linking it with android lib is also a bit complicated because of the limited number of functions implemented in android libc (and some other libs as well). To avoid this all you can directly open the device (/dev/vboxguest) and issue ioctl calls on it in the format that is known to vbox and your host service.</p>,,,0,,6/3/2011 16:36:38,,6/8/2011 18:51:44,6/8/2011 18:51:44,,498246,,498246,5914203,2,6,,

32406907,,<p>Your question is not related to the structures but to the way C evaluates expressions. You have <code>ptr</code> which is a pointer to some memory location that stores a structure. Basically is the address of a memory location (an integer value). Then you have 2 pointers Head and Current which are global pointers to a structure of the same type as ptr and you want to make them point to the same structure as ptr. Basically what you want is to allocate memory for the new structure which is referenced by ptr and make Head and Current point to the same memory location. Thus you want the following assignments:</p> <pre><code>Head = ptr; Current = ptr; </code></pre> <p>You can contract those 2 expressions in one:</p> <pre><code>Head = Current = ptr; </code></pre> <p> which is evaluated as:</p> <pre><code>(Head = (Current = ptr)); </code></pre> <p>So ptr is first assigned to Current then the value of that assignment (which is ptr) is assigned to Head. And now you have a Head which is the beginning of the linked list and a Current pointer which may be used for iteration and has an initial value equal to Head.</p>,,,0,,9/4/2015 21:34:27,,9/4/2015 21:34:27,,,,,2896626,32406806,2,3,,

34968384,,<p>It sounds like you may be interested in storing metadata in a persistent way along with your array. If so HDF5 is an excellent option to use as a storage container. </p> <p>For example let's create an array and save it to an HDF file with some metadata using <code>h5py</code>:</p> <pre><code>import numpy as np import h5py some_data = np.random.random((100 100)) with h5py.File('data.hdf' 'w') as outfile: dataset = outfile.create_dataset('my data' data=some_data) dataset.attrs['an arbitrary key'] = 'arbitrary values' dataset.attrs['foo'] = 10.2 </code></pre> <p>We can then read it back in:</p> <pre><code>import h5py with h5py.File('data.hdf' 'r') as infile: dataset = infile['my data'] some_data = dataset[...] # Load it into memory. Could also slice a subset. print dataset.attrs['an arbitrary key'] print dataset.attrs['foo'] </code></pre> <p>As others have mentioned if you are only concerned with storing the data + metadata in memory a better option is a <code>dict</code> or simple wrapper class. For example:</p> <pre><code>class Container: def __init__(self data **kwargs): self.data = data self.metadata = kwargs </code></pre> <p>Of course this won't behave like a numpy array directly but it's usually a bad idea to subclass <code>ndarrays</code>.

For example:</p> <p><a href= http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets rel= nofollow ><strong>Text</strong> characters</a> are defined as:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>Char ::= #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF] /* any Unicode character excluding the surrogate blocks FFFE and FFFF. */ </code></pre> <p>...</p> <p>Note:</p> <p>Document authors are encouraged to avoid compatibility characters  as defined in section 2.3 of [Unicode]. The characters defined in the following ranges are also discouraged. They are either control characters or permanently undefined Unicode characters:</p> <pre><code>[#x7F-#x84] [#x86-#x9F] [#xFDD0-#xFDEF] [#x1FFFE-#x1FFFF] [#x2FFFE-#x2FFFF] [#x3FFFE-#x3FFFF] [#x4FFFE-#x4FFFF] [#x5FFFE-#x5FFFF] [#x6FFFE-#x6FFFF] [#x7FFFE-#x7FFFF] [#x8FFFE-#x8FFFF] [#x9FFFE-#x9FFFF] [#xAFFFE-#xAFFFF] [#xBFFFE-#xBFFFF] [#xCFFFE-#xCFFFF] [#xDFFFE-#xDFFFF] [#xEFFFE-#xEFFFF] [#xFFFFE-#xFFFFF] [#x10FFFE-#x10FFFF]. </code></pre> </blockquote> <p><a href= http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-common-syn rel= nofollow ><strong>Whitespace</strong> characters</a> are defined as:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>S ::= (#x20 | #x9 | #xD | #xA)+ </code></pre> </blockquote> <p><a href= http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-common-syn rel= nofollow ><strong>Name and token</strong> characters</a> are defined as:</p> <blockquote> <pre><code>NameStartChar ::= : | [A-Z] | _ | [a-z] | [#xC0-#xD6] | [#xD8-#xF6] | [#xF8-#x2FF] | [#x370-#x37D] | [#x37F-#x1FFF] | [#x200C-#x200D] | [#x2070-#x218F] | [#x2C00-#x2FEF] | [#x3001-#xD7FF] | [#xF900-#xFDCF] | [#xFDF0-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#xEFFFF] NameChar ::= NameStartChar | - | . | [0-9] | #xB7 | [#x0300-#x036F] | [#x203F-#x2040] </code></pre> </blockquote> <p>Just to name a few. There are many more definitions for characters in Literals Comments Character data Processing Instructions CData sections etc etc etc.</p> <p>So you need to read the XML spec to know which Unicode codepoints are allowed in any given context within the XML. Different sections and syntax elements have different rules about what is and is not acceptable.</p>,,,0,,4/17/2015 2:56:23,,4/17/2015 2:56:23,,,,,65863,29679704,2,0,,

24642174,,<p>Perhaps someone better-versed in JAXB has a clever JAXB-centric solution but from the standpoint of generics I do not believe there is a way to do what you are trying to do. The type parameter information for the enclosing <code>BasicRequest</code> class is erased at runtime (see <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1079279/class-object-of-generic-class-java >Class object of generic class (java)</a>) so any <code>Class</code> object representing a <code>BasicRequest</code> will simply reflect the raw type. (Correspondingly the <code>Unmarshaller</code> will have no way to know what that parameter is intended to be.)</p> <p>You could try one of the following solutions:</p> <ol> <li>If you are certain that what the Unmarshaller returns will conform to BasicRequest then you could cast the result to <code>JAXBElement&lt;BasicRequest&lt;G&gt;&gt;</code>. The cast will produce an unchecked cast warning (again because of type erasure) which can be suppressed with the <code>@SuppressWarnings( unchecked )</code> annotation on the enclosing method if you wish.</li> <li><p>For each class you have which could take the place of G you could create a subclass which extends BasicRequest parameterized with that class i.e.:</p> <pre><code>public class SomeBasicRequest extends BasicRequest&lt;SomeRequest&gt; { ... } </code></pre> <p><code>SomeBasicRequest</code> would not be assignable from <code>Class&lt;BasicRequest&lt;G&gt;&gt;</code> though so you'd have to change the method header as follows:</p> <pre><code>public &lt;G extends BaseRequest&gt; BasicRequest&lt;G&gt; xmlToRequest(String xml Class&lt;? extends BasicRequest&lt;G&gt;&gt; t) { ... } </code></pre></li> </ol>,,,0,,7/8/2014 21:56:27,,7/8/2014 21:56:27,,,,,2162964,24640761,2,0,,

30389503,,<p>The typical way to do this is to add another record (MIME type NFC Forum external type or URI) to the tag in addition to the Android Application Record (AAR). In that case the AAR must be the last (or at least not the first) record of the NDEF message on the tag.</p> <p>You can then catch the tag discovery by filtering for that specific data type (i.e. the type of the <strong>first record</strong> of the NDEF message on your tag) using the <code>NDEF_DISCOVERED</code> intent filter. E.g. for an NFC Forum external type:</p> <pre><code>&lt;activity android:name= .MainActivity &gt; &lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name= android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED /&gt; &lt;category android:name= android.intent.category.DEFAULT /&gt; &lt;data android:scheme= vnd.android.nfc android:host= ext android:pathPrefix= /yourdomain.com:yourtypename /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;/activity&gt; </code></pre> <p>In that case the AAR will make sure that your app gets precedence over any other apps that registered for the same type and that Play Store is opend for your app if it's not already installed.</p> <p>If you do not register any activity for a matching <code>NDEF_DISCOVERED</code> intent filter the AAR will cause the first activity that has a <code>MAIN</code>/<code>LAUNCHER</code> intent filter (in that case Android won't pass a handle to the tag to your activity though). Hence if you neither register for <code>NDEF_DISCOVERED</code> intents nor for <code>MAIN</code>/<code>LAUNCHER</code> intents the AAR mechanism won't work.</p> <p><strong>But what if you want your tag to <em>only</em> contain an AAR and no other records?</strong></p> <p>You could do this by registering an intent filter for the AAR itself. The AAR is an NFC Forum external type with the type name urn:nfc:ext:<strong>android.com:pkg</strong>  so you could use the following intent filter:</p> <pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name= android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED /&gt; &lt;category android:name= android.intent.category.DEFAULT /&gt; &lt;data android:scheme= vnd.android.nfc android:host= ext android:pathPrefix= /android.com:pkg /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; </code></pre>,,,0,,5/22/2015 6:09:33,,5/22/2015 6:09:33,,,,,2425802,30286702,2,1,,

Well if there is no module declaration it is implicitly assumed to be <code>class Object</code> – but <code>Object</code> doesn't have a constant named <code>FOO</code> and neither do its ancestors <code>Kernel</code> and <code>BasicObject</code>.</li> </ol> <p>Ergo: Ruby is right.

It didn't remove <code>FOO</code> from the scope it was never in scope to begin with.</p> <p>[Ruby's reflection API actually gives you access to anything you need: #1 is exactly the same as <code>Module.nesting</code> and #2 is (almost) the same as <code>Module.nesting.first.ancestors</code>.]</p> <p>You might think: wait isn't <code>module_eval</code> a module declaration? No it isn't! It's just a method like any other method taking a block that's just like any other block. It doesn't alter the constant lookup rules in any way.</p> <p>Note that that's not quite true: after all e.g. <code>instance_eval</code> <em>does</em> change method lookup rules for example so it would not be inconceivable that <code>module_eval</code> changes constant lookup rules.

3384522,,<p>I had this same question when I was reading Java Concurrency In Practice and I thought I'd add some added perspective on the answers provided by Jon Skeet and spullara.</p> <p>Here's some example code which will block even the quick <code>setValue(int)</code>/<code>getValue()</code> methods while the <code>doStuff(ValueHolder)</code> method executes.</p> <pre><code>public class ValueHolder { private int value = 0; public synchronized void setValue(int v) { // Or could use a sychronized(this) block... this.value = 0; } public synchronized int getValue() { return this.value; } } public class MaliciousClass { public void doStuff(ValueHolder holder) { synchronized(holder) { // Do something expensive so setter/getter calls are blocked } } } </code></pre> <p>The downside of using <code>this</code> for synchronization is other classes can synchronize on a reference to your class (not via <code>this</code> of course). Malicious or unintentional use of the <code>synchronized</code> keyword while locking on your object's reference can cause your class to behave poorly under concurrent usage as an external class can effectively block your <code>this</code>-synchronized methods and there is nothing you can do (in your class) to prohibit this at runtime. To avoid this potential pitfall you would synchronize on a <code>private final Object</code> or use the <code>Lock</code> interface in <code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code>.</p> <p>For this simple example you could alternately use an <code>AtomicInteger</code> rather than synchronizing the setter/getter.</p>,,,0,,8/2/2010 1:45:15,,8/2/2010 1:45:15,,,,,64881,3369287,2,7,,

Also little concerned when you say you ran configure and THEN navigated to the 24.5 directory? You should be running make install from the same directory/folder where you ran configure. You also didn't indicate you had run make bootstrap.</p> <p>The steps should be</p> <ul> <li>scp emacs-24.5.tar.gz user@remote-host:~</li> <li>ssh user@remote-host</li> <li>tar xzf emacs-24.5.tar.gz</li> <li>cd emacs-24.5</li> <li>./configure</li> <li>make bootstrap</li> <li>sudo make install</li> <li>Notice in the output from the make install there are directions on an additional command you need to run to set movemail permissions. This command also needs to be run under sudo</li> </ul> <p>I'm assuming your not ssh'ing intot the remote host as root as this would be a bad practice. This means that when you do the make install you need to run the process with root privileges so you need to use sudo. </p> <p>You should also check the output from configure and make sure there are no errors. Configure will also list emacs features which are turned on/off depending on whether you have various supporting libraries installed. If you scroll the terminal output from configure up a couple of pages you will see the printout. If there are features listed with a 'no' which you want/expect you will need to go through the documentation and work out which additional supporting libraries you need.

4108488,,<p>The code you already have covers the <em>general</em> functionality that you need which is to set the value of a button to a particular string.</p> <p>The expansion that you're looking at is a matter of changing the value of this string to one of three values. First step might be to look at how you would be able to change a value more than one (not necessarily wrapping). This could be done in a straightforward manner with an array something like the following:</p> <pre><code>var labels = [ Initial  Value has changed  Value changed again ]; var index = 0; function valChange() { index++; document.myForm.myButton.value = labels[index]; } </code></pre> <p>That's great for up to two clicks but it breaks beyond that because you go past the end of the array. The trick to get the full looping pattern then is to <em>reset</em> the counter to zero once it goes past the end effectively making your array circular:</p> <pre><code>function valChange() { index++; if (index == labels.length) { index = 0; } document.myForm.myButton.value = labels[index]; } </code></pre> <p>And voila! Every time the <code>valChange</code> function is called the index is incremented so the <em>next</em> label will be different and it handles the circularity constraint as required.</p> <p>Note that this implementation doesn't <em>strictly</em> look at what the label's current value is; rather it maintains its own version of this state via the <code>index</code> counter. This is arguably simpler and cleaner if you know that this method will be the only way that the label can be modified. However if the label might arbitrarily be changed to a different value by external code you might want to work out the index on the fly by getting the button's current label and comparing it to each array element in turn. This is slower a little clumsier but more robust in the face of external modifications.</p>,,,0,,11/5/2010 17:36:44,,11/5/2010 17:36:44,,,,,45664,4108440,2,2,,

The partition keys are stored in sorted order so we know that pk027 comes after pk025. </p> <p>In this over simplified example if the partition summary were set to sample every 10 partition keys then it would contain a map to ten partition keys and their location on disk within the partition index. For example pk001 -> beginning of file pk010 -> location of pk010 in the index file and so on.</p> <p>Now when C* gets a request for pk027 it knows that pk027 is located after pk020.

(This was do to a client's request to re implement an existing service so they didn't have to change their code.)</p> <p>So for example if you have </p> <pre><code>&lt;SomeResponse xmlns='some url'&gt; &lt; object&gt; &lt;element&gt;data&lt;/element &gt; &lt;/object&gt; &lt;/SomeResponse &gt; </code></pre> <p>It needs to be formatted like this for .net to parse the xml correctly. <code></p> <pre><code>&lt;SomeResponse xmls='some url'&gt; &lt;SomeResult xmlns:a='some url' xmlns:i=''&gt; &lt;a:object&gt; &lt;a:element&gt;&lt;/a:element&gt; &lt;/a:object&gt; &lt;/SomeResult&gt; &lt;/SomeResposne&gt; </code></pre> <p></code></p> <p>So it looks like the response data needs to be encapsulated by a Result tag which is the concatenation of the function name with the string Result .

From my own test I find out that turning screen updating off and on takes about 15ms (tested in C# via Excel Interop). Keep that on mind if you will execute anything which would take less time. And after all don’t turn screen updating on/off many times in some loop. That would be real performance killer.</p> <p>And one more note (which you probably don’t want to hear) if you want it quick use C++.

You'll need to download the free command-line version of Putty called plink from <a href= http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html rel= nofollow >here</a>. In this approach you're streaming the data on your command-line and transferring the data into a local text file.</p> <pre><code>cmd = C:\MyUtilities\plink.exe -pw PASSWORD USERNAME@IPADDRESS cat /dataops/profits/name.csv Set datafile = CreateObject( Scripting.FileSystemObject ).CreateTextFile( c:\name.csv  True) Set WshShell = CreateObject( WScript.Shell ) Set oExec = WshShell.Exec(cmd) Do While oExec.Status = 0 If Not oExec.StdOut.AtEndOfStream Then datafile.WriteLine oExec.StdOut.Readall End If Loop datafile.Close </code></pre> <p>2) Another approach would be to run a Windows scheduled task batch file that uses FTP to transfer the file over as explained <a href= http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16158138/how-to-ftp-with-a-batch-file >here</a>. Personally I think this will be your best bet because the VBA code can be focused on just loading up the file rather than connecting to Unix and getting the file too.</p> <p>3) If you have a Samba share set up on your Unix server for a directory then you'll be able to see that directory from Windows and can just go there to get the file. </p> <p>Once you have the file on your Windows computer you can open Excel and load the file like this:</p> <pre><code>Set xl = CreateObject( Excel.Application ) xl.Visible = True Set wb = xl.Workbooks.Open( c:\name.csv ) </code></pre>,,,0,,4/9/2015 14:00:34,,4/9/2015 14:00:34,,,,,1359088,29519617,2,0,,

Having a uniform syntax solves part of the problem for things that have vastly different semantics and it's not a trivial problem in the slightest.</p> <p>Similarly text-encoding is used in markup (including XML) computer programs writing human-readable documents and many more tasks with vastly different semantics.

ASCII only seems simple these days because so many of the complicated features of its control codes are no longer used old school ASCII uses are often way more complicated than Unicode).</p> <p>Numbers are used all over the place in computing and we still have four different internal syntaxes in use (two endian styles two complement styles) though the details are generally hidden these days.</p> <p>As well as doing one chunk of the work of the creator of the format for them and demonstrating one chunk of the work for the producer or consumer is one they are already familiar with (and hence may already have tools for) it completely eliminates one chunk of the work for a producer-consumer who is reading in one format and writing in another.</p>,,,0,,8/15/2010 14:46:15,,8/15/2010 14:46:15,,,,,400547,3485759,2,3,,

2563764,,<p>You can't modify a file without opening it. The simplest way of doing that is to open it and truncate it while you open it which in PHP would look like this:</p> <pre><code>fclose(fopen($filename w+ )); </code></pre> <p>If you're going to invoke a unix shell (which is what the system() call does) the simplest way is to redirect /dev/null to the file so in PHP that would be:</p> <pre><code>system( &gt;$filename &lt;/dev/null ); </code></pre> <p>There's a lot more overhead to this approach but it can be generalized and translated to any language or environment where you have a shell. There are other answers on this thread that have you calling system() to rm and then touch to recreate the file - besides being non-atomic that approach also scares me much more.</p>,,,0,,4/1/2010 21:16:23,,4/1/2010 21:16:23,,,,,7548,2563691,2,0,,
