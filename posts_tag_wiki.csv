5130474,,"<p>Ramaze is a web application framework created by Michael Fellinger (also known as manveru) for Ruby. The philosophy of it could be expressed in a mix of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">KISS</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_surprise"" rel=""nofollow"">POLS</a>, trying to make simple things simple and complex things possible. This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some Ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve perfect custom-tailored results. </p>

<p>Another one of the goals during development of Ramaze was to make every part as modular and therefore reusable as possible, not only to provide a basic understanding after the first glance, but also to make it as simple as possible to reuse parts of the code. </p>

<p>The original purpose of Ramaze was to act as a kind of framework to build web-frameworks, this was made obsolete by the introduction of rack, which provides this feature at a better level without trying to enforce any structural layout of the resulting framework.</p>

<h2>Basic Example</h2>

<pre><code>require 'ramaze'

class MainController &lt; Ramaze::Controller
  def index
    ""Hello, Ramaze!""
  end
end

Ramaze.start
</code></pre>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Installing Ramaze is super easy when using Rubygems:</p>

<pre><code>$ gem install ramaze
</code></pre>

<p>Once the gem is installed you can create a new application using the ""ramaze"" binary:</p>

<pre><code>$ ramaze create myapp
</code></pre>

Logger: The main entity on which applications make logging calls. A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component.
LogRecord: Used to pass logging requests between the logging framework and individual log handlers.</p>

<p>Handler: Exports LogRecord objects to a variety of destinations including memory, output streams, consoles, files, and sockets. A variety of Handler subclasses exist for this purpose. Additional Handlers may be developed by third parties and delivered on top of the core platform.</p>

<p>Level: Defines a set of standard logging levels that can be used to control logging output. Programs can be configured to output logging for some levels while ignoring output for others.</p>

<p>Filter: Provides fine-grained control over what gets logged, beyond the control provided by log levels. The logging APIs support a general-purpose filter mechanism that allows application code to attach arbitrary filters to control logging output.</p>

<p><strong>Code block</strong> is a section of code which is grouped together. Code blocks consist of one or more declarations and statements.   </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The function of code blocks in programming is to enable groups of
  statements to be treated as if they were one statement, and to narrow
  the lexical scope of variables, procedures and functions declared in a
  block so that they do not conflict with variables having the same name
  used elsewhere in a program for different purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The notion of blocks is introduced by different syntax in different languages, but there are two broad families: </p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>ALGOL</strong> family in which blocks are delimited by the keywords <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code>, and </li>
<li>The <strong>C</strong> family in which blocks are delimited by curly braces <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>A programming language that permits the creation of blocks, including blocks nested within other blocks, is called a <strong>block-structured programming language</strong>.  </p>

<p>In a block-structured programming language, the names of variables and other objects such as procedures which are declared in outer blocks are visible inside other inner blocks, unless they are shadowed by an object of the same name</p>",,,0,,1/10/2013 6:03:09,,1/10/2013 6:25:51,1/10/2013 6:25:51,user966588,,user966588,,,5,0,,

It is available in both versions 2 and 3.  Use this tag for questions explicitly dealing with the isinstance built-in.</p>

<p>The schematics for the function are below:</p>

<pre><code>isinstance(object, class-or-type-or-tuple) -&gt; bool
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>object</code> is the object to test and <code>class-or-type-or-tuple</code> is a class, type, or tuple of classes and/or types.  </p>

<p>When invoked, and given a single class or type as its second argument, the function will return either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on whether or not the first argument is an instance of the second.  Below is a demonstration:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(1, int)
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance(1, str)
False
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If the function is given a tuple of classes and/or types as its second argument, it will return either <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> depending on whether or not the first argument is an instance of <em>any</em> of the classes/types contained in the tuple. Below is a demonstration:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('a', (int, str))
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; isinstance('a', (int, bool))
False

17720461,,"<p>The term ""name collision"" has been used in computer science for more than 3 decades, when referring to names in various classification systems. Most of the time, a name collision must be resolved immediately in some way, whether automatically by an operating system or compiler or manually through user input and decisions. The concept of a namespace sometimes resolves collision issues by creating different logical regions in which items with similar names can co-exist without ambiguity. In certain programming instances, a name collision might not be immediately evident, occasionally leading to hard-to-find program errors that can result from the compiler making certain assumptions about the names of items used.</p>

<p>An example of how a name collision can occur involves two directories full of files. If each directory contains a file named ""DATA"", and the contents of one directory are copied into the other, then the computer's attempts to copy the file named DATA will find that a file with the same name already exists in the target directory. This creates a name collision. In this instance, the user usually will be prompted and allowed to choose from a list of resolutions, including renaming one of the files, not copying the file or overwriting one of the files.</p>

<p>One commonly used solution for a name collision is the implementation of namespaces. A namespace is simply a way to define an area under which object names are contained. In the above example, a directory technically is a namespace, meaning multiple files can all have the same name as long as they are each in different directories.</p>

<p>From a programming perspective, a name collision can occur in situations such as multiple inheritance, overlapping variable scopes, or even with imported libraries in some languages. In general, a compiler will notice a conflict and generate a warning or error, although this might not always be the case. Other than using namespaces, collisions in many programming languages can be avoided by using qualifiers. A qualifier usually is a prefix that can be placed in front of a variable or class name to distinguish it from another variable with the same name.</p>",,,0,,7/18/2013 10:06:42,,7/18/2013 10:58:22,7/18/2013 10:58:22,user2140173,,user2140173,,,5,0,,

<p>Here are some definitions of posterization:</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterization"" rel=""nofollow"">Posterization</a> of an image entails conversion of a continuous gradation of tone to several regions of fewer tones, with abrupt changes from one tone to another. This was originally done with photographic processes to create posters. </p>

<p><a href=""http://www.cambridgeincolour.com/tutorials/posterization.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Posterization</a> occurs when an image's apparent bit depth has been decreased so much that it has a visual impact. The term posterization is used because it can influence your photo similar to how the colors may look in a mass-produced poster, where the print process uses a limited number of color inks. This effect ranges from subtle to quite pronounced, although one's tolerance for posterization may vary.</p>

19040122,,"<p><strong>Seriously.js</strong> is a real-time, node-based video compositor for the web.</p>

<p>Inspired by professional software such as After Effects and Nuke, Seriously.js renders high-quality video effects, but allows them to be dynamic and interactive.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p><strong>WebGL</strong></p>

<p>Seriously.js requires a browser that supports WebGL. Development is targeted to and tested in Firefox (4.0+) and Google Chrome (9+). Safari and Opera are expected to support WebGL in the near future. There are no public plans for Internet Explorer to support WebGL.</p>

<p>Even though a browser may support WebGL, the ability to run it depends on the system's graphics card. Serioulsy.js is heavily optimized, so most modern desktops and notebooks should be sufficient. Older systems may run slower, especially when using high-resolution videos.</p>

<p>Mobile browser support for WebGL is limited. Mobile Firefox has some support, but the Android Browser and Mobile Safari do not.</p>

<p>Seriously.js provides a method to detect browser support and offer descriptive error messages wherever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-Origin Videos and Images</strong></p>

<p>Due to security limitations of WebGL, Seriously.js can only process video or images that are served from the same domain, unless they are served with CORS headers. Firefox 12 and up support CORS for video but other browsers do not, and videos served with CORS are rare. So for now, it is best to host your own video files.</p>

<p>A Webmachine application is a set of resources, each of which is a set of functions over the state of the resource. We really mean functions here, not object-methods, infinite-server-loops, or any other such construction. This aspect of Webmachine is one of the reasons why Webmachine applications are relatively easy to understand and extend.</p>

<p>These functions give you a place to define the representations and other Web-relevant properties of your application's resources -- with the emphasis that the first-class things on the Web are resources and that their essential properties of interaction are already quite well defined and usefully constrained.</p>

<p>For most Webmachine applications, most of the functions are quite small and isolated. One of the nice effects of this is that a quick reading of a resource will give you an understanding of the application, its Web behavior, and the relationship between them. Since these functions are usually referentially transparent, Webmachine applications can be quite easy to test. There's no need for mock objects, fake database connections, or any other wastes of time when you can write tests against each component of your application in terms of the input and output to various functions.</p>

<p>We believe that by giving Web developers a system with conventions that directly map to HTTP and REST, we help them to write and extend Web applications quickly while not dictating the shape of the rest of their application.

<ul>

<p>The BFG Repo-Cleaner is even officially endorsed as an alternative in the <a href=""https://gitirc.eu/git-filter-branch.html#_notes"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official Git documentation for filter-branch</a> itself:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>git-filter-branch allows you to make complex shell-scripted rewrites
  of your Git history, but you probably don’t need this flexibility if
  you’re simply <em>removing unwanted data</em> like large files or passwords.
  For those operations you may want to consider <a href=""https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The BFG
  Repo-Cleaner</a>, a JVM-based
  alternative to git-filter-branch, typically at least 10-50x faster for
  those use-cases, and with quite different characteristics:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>Any particular version of a file is cleaned exactly <em>once</em>. The BFG, unlike git-filter-branch, does not give you the opportunity to handle
  a file differently based on where or when it was committed within your
  history. This constraint gives the core performance benefit of The
  BFG, and is well-suited to the task of cleansing bad data - you don’t
  care <em>where</em> the bad data is, you just want it <em>gone</em>.</p></li>
  <li><p>By default The BFG takes full advantage of multi-core machines, cleansing commit file-trees in parallel. git-filter-branch cleans
  commits sequentially (ie in a single-threaded manner), though it <em>is</em>
  possible to write filters that include their own parallellism, in the
  scripts executed against each commit.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <a href=""https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/#examples"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">command options</a> are much
  more restrictive than git-filter branch, and dedicated just to the
  tasks of removing unwanted data- e.g: <code>--strip-blobs-bigger-than 1M</code>.</p></li>

<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In computing, <em>just-in-time compilation</em> (<em>JIT</em>), also known as <em>dynamic translation</em>, is a
  method to improve the runtime performance of computer programs based on bytecode.</p>
  
  <p>JIT compilers represent a hybrid approach, with translation occurring continuously, as with
  interpreters, but with caching of translated code to minimize performance degradation. They
  also offer handling of late-bound data types and the ability to enforce security guarantees.</p>
  
  <p>In a bytecode-compiled system, source code is translated to an intermediate representation
  known as <em>bytecode</em>. The JIT compiler reads the bytecode and compiles it dynamically into
  machine language so the program can run faster.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Tag usage</h2>

4933607,,"<p>Multi-threading is a common model to implement SM in multi-cored machines, where threads share memory through shared variables. In this model in parallel programming a processor can create multiple threads that will be executed in parallel. Each thread has its own stack, variables and ID, considered private state. For every thread there is a unique heap shared by all, then considered shared memory. </p>

<p>In order to allow a volume of work to be most effectively and safely divided into multiple concurrent streams of execution, a number of critical areas need to be addressed. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Scheduling</strong>: ensure worker tasks are able to progress independently and effectively (e.g. deadlock/livelock avoidance)</li>
<li><strong>Publication</strong>: ensure data altered in one thread is only visible to others as expected</li>
<li><strong>Synchronization</strong>: ensure critical regions are protected from multiple concurrent updates causing data loss/corruption.</li>
</ul>

<p>The underlying tenet of concurrent processing is Amdahl's law (<a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/AmdahlsLaw.svg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graph</a>).  This law governs the diminishing amount of throughput that can be achieved by greater numbers of concurrent processors/cores. Therefore the overall aim of multi-threading is to minimize the amount of serial execution (exclusive locking) within any concurrent system.</p>

<p>In signal processing or computing noise can be considered random unwanted data without meaning; that is, data that is not being used to transmit a signal, but is simply produced as an unwanted by-product of other activities. ""Signal-to-noise ratio"" (SNR) is sometimes used to refer to the ratio of useful to irrelevant information in an exchange.</p>

<p>Noise is usually uncorrelated and have a specific distribution that describes it (uniform, Gaussian, etc).
The color of a noise signal is generally understood to be some broad characteristic of its power spectrum.
Different ""colors"" of noise have significantly different properties. The practice of naming kinds of noise after colors started with ""white noise"", a signal whose spectrum has equal power within any equal interval of frequencies. That name was given by analogy with ""white light"", which was assumed to have such a ""flat"" power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like ""pink"", ""red"", and ""blue"" were then given to noise with other spectral profiles; often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra. Some of those names have standard definitions in certain disciplines, while others are very informal and poorly defined.</p>

<p>Encoding of a file is achieved by converting information into another form of representation. The information can be then converted in any file format. 
The encoding of a file must follow the rules of file format specifications. Every known file format has its own header structure and while writing a file, encoder must obey rules of file header format.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:
Analog data which comes through a device sensor or a <code>camera</code> can be converted into digital data which later can be written in a file with image formats like <code>.BMP</code> <code>.JPG</code> <code>.PNG</code> <code>TIFF</code> <code>GIF</code> etc.
The BMP or Bitmap file format is a common and simplest kind of image format which can be encoded with various encoding schemes like Monochrome encoding, 24-Bit encoding etc. and This must be done so that the Decoder applications, browsers and Image viewers can decode the encoded file formats.</p>

11766412,,"<p><strong>Hammer is a open-source library that can recognize gestures made by touch, mouse and pointerEvents. It has support for multiple instances the same time, so you can start creating multi-user touch interfaces. Hammer doesn't have any dependencies, and it's small, only 3.7 kB minified + gzipped!</strong></p>

<p>Visit the website: <a href=""http://hammerjs.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hammerjs.github.io/</a></p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>It's easy to use, just include the library and create a new instance.
<code>js
var hammertime = new Hammer(element, options);
hammertime.on('pan', function(ev) {
    console.log(ev);
});
</code></p>

<p>By default it adds a set of <code>tap</code>, <code>doubletap</code>, <code>press</code>, <em>horizontal</em> <code>pan</code> and <code>swipe</code>, and the
multi-touch <code>pinch</code> and <code>rotate</code> recognizers. The pinch and rotate recognizers are disabled by default
because they would make the element blocking, but you can enable them by calling
<code>js
mc.get('pinch').set({ enable: true });
mc.get('rotate').set({ enable: true });
</code></p>

<p>Also the viewport meta tag is recommended, it gives more control back to the webpage by disabling the
doubletap/pinch zoom. More recent browsers that support the touch-action property don't require this.
<code>html
&lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1""&gt;
</code></p>

<h3>More control</h3>

<p>You can setup your own set of recognizers for your instance. This requires a bit more code, but it gives you more
control about the gestures that are being recognized.
<code>js
var myOptions = { };
var mc = new Hammer.Manager(myElement, myOptions);
    mc.add(new Hammer.Pan({ direction: Hammer.DIRECTION_ALL, threshold: 0 }));
    mc.add(new Hammer.Tap({ event: 'quadrupletap', taps: 4 }));
    mc.on(""pan"", handlePan);
mc.on(""quadrupletap"", handleTaps);
</code>
The example above creates an instance containing a <code>pan</code> and a <code>quadrupletap</code> gesture. The recognizer instances you
create a being executed in the order they are added, and only one can be recognized at the time.</p>

<p>See the pages about the <code>recognizeWith</code> and <code>requireFailure</code> for
more details.</p>

OpenMP offers easy access to multi-threading without requiring knowledge of system-dependent details. At the same time, it is reasonably efficient compared to fine-tuned implementations with the bonus of being easiest to write multi-threads code. Forums and complete information on OpenMP is at <a href=""https://openmp.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://openmp.org/</a>.</p>
<p>OpenMP is based on multi-thread model, and offers Shared Memory parallelism and heterogeneous programming for coprocessors through compiler directives, library routines and environment variables. It is restricted to C/C++ and Fortran applications, however provides portability across different Shared Memory architectures.</p>
<p>It is through directives, added by the programmer to the code, that the compiler adds parallelism in the application. OpenMP can be used in single or multi-cores machines, in the first architecture the compiler directives are ignored, thus the application is executed in a sequential manner, promoting portability between the two architectures.</p>

<p>JORAM fully supports JMS 1.1 and Java EE 5 with support for transient, persistent, transactional and XA messaging (JORAM provide a fully functional XAResource implementation, JORAM sessions can then be enlisted in any JTA transaction acording to the normal JTA semantics).</p>

<p>All the features described in the JMS 1.1 specification are provided by JORAM.
JORAM is an open-source software component released under the LGPL license. JORAM availability on a wide range of Java-based platforms - from J2EETM to J2METM allows your ownership investment to be rationalized over your numerous heterogeneous systems and Internet devices.</p>

<p>JORAM is an all-in-one mature messaging solution, it includes many features that are missing in competitive offerings and it does not require third-party products, it provides a built-in atomic storage and a distributed JNDI server. JORAM is shipped with multiples transport implementations: an InVM transport implementation for when both the client(s) and server are in the same Java virtual machine, and also a TCP based implementation when clients and server are remote.</p>

<p>In default configuration it only requires standard JDK classes to run.</p>

<p>When the asnyc attribute is found the parser continues rendering the page without ""blocking"" until the script has loaded. This can further reduce the rendering of html pages as the JavaScript files are downloaded asynchronously. In traditional parser behavior, scripts are downloaded as they are parsed in the HTML object tree. The parser will wait until a HTTP Response is received and the content is downloaded (when applicable).</p>

<p>To use the async attribute on a script file you simply have to add the property to your script element as depicted below.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" async src=""foo.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Although traditional asynchronous commands are executed in parallel, the <code>asnyc</code> attribute will instruct the parser to retrieve the file as the first opportunity <em>after</em> the page has finished downloading and <em>before</em> windows' <code>load</code> event. </p>

<p>The async attribute is only supported on external script files and not for inline scripts (script tags where the src attribute is present).</p>

<p>This library focuses on <strong>contract-first</strong> and <strong>pure functional</strong> encoding and decoding of binary data. The following design constraints are considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>Binary structure should mirror protocol definitions and be self-evident under casual reading</li>
<li>Mapping binary structures to types should be statically verified</li>
<li>Encoding and decoding should be purely functional</li>
<li>Failures in encoding and decoding should provide descriptive errors

<p>As a result, the library is implemented as a combinator based DSL. Performance is considered but yields to the above design constraints.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The <code>mysql</code> extension was <strong>deprecated</strong> in PHP version 5.5, and <strong>removed</strong> in version 7.0. Code written for modern servers must use the <code>mysqli</code> or <code>pdo</code> extensions instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to an object-oriented interface, most <code>mysqli</code> features also provide an equivalent procedural interface through functions prefixed <code>mysqli_</code>. However, these functions were <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/14710384"">primarily intended</a> for users transitioning away from legacy code using the mysql extension. Code in a modern environment is expected to use object-oriented programming.</p>

<p>The <code>mysqli</code> extension's prepared statement support makes use of <code>?</code> placeholders bound to variable references for input, and variable references bound to columns when fetching output rows. Please note that, in order to use some aspects of <code>mysqli</code> prepared statements (most notably <a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/en/mysqli-stmt.get-result.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mysqli_stmt_get_result</a>), your installation of PHP must use the <a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/en/intro.mysqlnd.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mysql Native Driver</a> (<code>mysqlnd</code>), which also provides improved performance over the older MySQL Client Library.</p>

This can come in a variety of ways depending on the device, but the purpose is the same. Root access will give the user the ability to install software outside approved methods. It also allows you direct access to OS files that you would not normally have access to.</p>
<p>Questions that should have the <code>jailbreak</code> tag would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieving an escalation of privileges or entitlements</li>
<li>accessing system file locations</li>
<li>creating 'jailbroken' apps or tweaks to other apps</li>
</ul>
<p>As the iOS platform is locked from user modification and the confines of the App Store, a need arose to allow users to install apps and change the OS to work around and outside the basic offerings of the OS. While some methods can be reused, Apple generally tries to close any open loopholes that allow this to happen. This creates the cycle of closing the holes and finding new ones to gain root access to the device. In the iPhone's short history, access has always been obtained.</p>
<p>While jailbreaking your device is generally regarded as being a safe practice, it is not for the faint of heart. Some methods can be very complicated to achieve a proper jailbreak, and others like the <a href=""http://jailbreakme.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jailbreakme.com</a> exploit can be very easy. It is suggested that before you attempt to jailbreak your device that you back it up and read the proper documentation for your device and OS version.</p>

<p><strong>What is it?</strong><br>
Geppetto is an extension for Backbone.js that implements an event-driven Command framework, decoupling your View/Presenter code from your app's business logic. Geppetto is lightweight, weighing in around half a kilobyte minified and gzipped.</p>

<p>The architecture of Geppetto was greatly inspired by the popular Robotlegs framework for Actionscript.</p>

<p><strong>Why Another Framework?</strong></p>

<p>Backbone has been called an MV* framework, because it's not strictly MVC, MVP, nor any other MV-something. Sure, the Backbone Router can be made to act ""controllery,"" but it's not really a good idea to tie all your business logic to URL change events.</p>

<p>More commonly, in Backbone applications you'll find business logic implemented directly in Backbone.View components, or sometimes in the Model. For smaller apps, it's convenient to declare your ""events"" and your callback functions in the same place. But as applications grow, and business logic needs to be reused across separate view components, this practice starts to get messy.</p>

<p>To solve this issue, Geppetto implements a scalable Controller architecture for Backbone, prescribing an MVC-style separation of concerns. This makes it possible to write code that is loosely-coupled, easy-to-reuse, and highly-testable.</p>",,,0,,7/2/2013 16:04:58,,7/2/2013 16:15:00,7/2/2013 16:15:00,,1684480,,1684480,,5,0,,

<p>It was released in August 2002, became the standard version used by more Delphi developers than any other single version. It is one of the most successful IDEs created by Borland because of its stability, speed and low hardware requirements, and remained in active use as of 2011. Delphi 7 added support for Windows XP Themes, and added more support for building Web applications. It was the last version of Delphi which could be used without mandatory software activation.</p>

<p>Its release immediately preceded a period of turbulence in the history of Borland/CodeGear/Embarcadero that, combined with Delphi 7's robustness, contributed to its widespread use and longevity.  In this regard, Delphi 7 can be considered the counterpart to MSVC6.</p>

<p>Delphi 7 introduced full support for XP themes, probably the most significant enhancement over Delphi 6.</p>

<p>Delphi 7 was preceded by <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/delphi-6/info"">Delphi 6</a> and succeeded by Delphi 8 (Codename: Octane).</p>

<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model { }

$this-&gt;load-&gt;model('post_model', 'post');

$this-&gt;post-&gt;get_all();

$this-&gt;post-&gt;get(1);
$this-&gt;post-&gt;get_by('title', 'Pigs CAN Fly!');
$this-&gt;post-&gt;get_many_by('status', 'open');

$this-&gt;post-&gt;insert(array(
    'status' =&gt; 'open',
    'title' =&gt; ""I'm too sexy for my shirt""
));

$this-&gt;post-&gt;update(1, array( 'status' =&gt; 'closed' ));

$this-&gt;post-&gt;delete(1);
Installation/Usage
</code></pre>

<p>Download and drag the MY_Model.php file into your application/core folder. CodeIgniter will load and initialise this class automatically for you.</p>

<p>Extend your model classes from MY_Model and all the functionality will be baked in automatically.</p>

<p>Naming Conventions</p>

<p>This class will try to guess the name of the table to use, by finding the plural of the class name.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model { }
...will guess a table name of posts. It also works with _m:

class Book_m extends MY_Model { }
...will guess books.
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to set it to something else, you can declare the $_table instance variable and set it to the table name:</p>

<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model
{
    public $_table = 'blogposts';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the CRUD functions also assume that your primary key ID column is called 'id'. You can overwrite this functionality by setting the $primary_key instance variable:</p>

<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model
{
    public $primary_key = 'post_id';
}
Callbacks/Observers
</code></pre>

<p>There are many times when you'll need to alter your model data before it's inserted or returned. This could be adding timestamps, pulling in relationships or deleting dependent rows. The MVC pattern states that these sorts of operations need to go in the model. In order to facilitate this, MY_Model contains a series of callbacks/observers -- methods that will be called at certain points.</p>

<p>The full list of observers are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$before_create
$after_create
$before_update
$after_update
$before_get
$after_get
$before_delete
$after_delete
</code></pre>

<p>These are instance variables usually defined at the class level. They are arrays of methods on this class to be called at certain points. An example:</p>

<pre><code>class Book_model extends MY_Model
{
    public $before_create = array( 'timestamps' );

    protected function timestamps($book)
    {
        $book['created_at'] = $book['updated_at'] = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
        return $book;
    }
}
Remember to always always always return the $row object you're passed. Each observer overwrites its predecessor's data, sequentially, in the order the observers are defined.

Observers can also take parameters in their name, much like CodeIgniter's Form Validation library. Parameters are then accessed in $this-&gt;callback_parameters:

public $before_create = array( 'data_process(name)' );
public $before_update = array( 'data_process(date)' );

protected function data_process($row)
{
    $row[$this-&gt;callback_parameters[0]] = $this-&gt;_process($row[$this-&gt;callback_parameters[0]]);

    return $row;
}
Validation

MY_Model uses CodeIgniter's built in form validation to validate data on insert.

You can enable validation by setting the $validate instance to the usual form validation library rules array:

class User_model extends MY_Model
{
    public $validate = array(
        array( 'field' =&gt; 'email', 
               'label' =&gt; 'email',
               'rules' =&gt; 'required|valid_email|is_unique[users.email]' ),
        array( 'field' =&gt; 'password',
               'label' =&gt; 'password',
               'rules' =&gt; 'required' ),
        array( 'field' =&gt; 'password_confirmation',
               'label' =&gt; 'confirm password',
               'rules' =&gt; 'required|matches[password]' ),
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Anything valid in the form validation library can be used here. To find out more about the rules array, please view the library's documentation.</p>

<p>With this array set, each call to insert() or update() will validate the data before allowing the query to be run. Unlike the CodeIgniter validation library, this won't validate the POST data, rather, it validates the data passed directly through.</p>

<p>You can skip the validation with skip_validation():</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;user_model-&gt;skip_validation();
$this-&gt;user_model-&gt;insert(array( 'email' =&gt; 'blah' ));
Alternatively, pass through a TRUE to insert():

$this-&gt;user_model-&gt;insert(array( 'email' =&gt; 'blah' ), TRUE);
Under the hood, this calls validate().
</code></pre>

<p>Protected Attributes</p>

<p>If you're lazy like me, you'll be grabbing the data from the form and throwing it straight into the model. While some of the pitfalls of this can be avoided with validation, it's a very dangerous way of entering data; any attribute on the model (any column in the table) could be modified, including the ID.</p>

<p>To prevent this from happening, MY_Model supports protected attributes. These are columns of data that cannot be modified.</p>

<p>You can set protected attributes with the $protected_attributes array:</p>

<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model
{
    public $protected_attributes = array( 'id', 'hash' );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when insert or update is called, the attributes will automatically be removed from the array, and, thus, protected:</p>

<pre><code>$this-&gt;post_model-&gt;insert(array(
    'id' =&gt; 2,
    'hash' =&gt; 'aqe3fwrga23fw243fWE',
    'title' =&gt; 'A new post'
));

// SQL: INSERT INTO posts (title) VALUES ('A new post')
Relationships
</code></pre>

<p>MY_Model now has support for basic belongs_to and has_many relationships. These relationships are easy to define:</p>

<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model
{
    public $belongs_to = array( 'author' );
    public $has_many = array( 'comments' );
[}
</code></pre>

It was announced at the company's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013, and was released on September 18, 2013. It includes a redesigned user interface and a number of changes to the operating system's functionality. The design of iOS 7's new elements was led by Jony Ive, Apple's Senior Vice President of Design.</p>

<p>iOS 7 was unveiled during the opening keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013. Billed as the ""biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone"", the most noticeable change was an overhaul of the user interface. In a promotional video shown during the keynote, Ive described the update as ""bringing order to complexity"", highlighting features such as refined typography, new icons, translucency, layering, physics, and gyroscope-driven parallaxing as some of the major changes to the design. The design of both iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) noticeably depart from skeuomorphic elements such as green felt in Game Center, wood in Newsstand, and leather in Calendar, in favor of flatter graphic design. The UI itself is not flat, but rather a multi-plane 2.5D zooming user interface. In his segment of the iOS presentation, Federighi emphasized ten major feature additions and changes.</p>

<p>The icons for iOS 7 were reportedly designed by Apple's marketing team, with them being told to design the apps around the color palette of the icons; straying from the usual design methodology of iOS. iOS 7 uses a similar color palette to that of the original Apple logo. It was also noted that Apple's website displayed different icons for several iOS 7 apps for a period of time, leading to speculation that the icons were already in the process of being changed as the design continues to develop.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>

<p>iOS 7 supports the following devices:</p>

<ul>

5337393,,"<p><strong>ETL</strong> is a process prominent especially in data warehousing. The term is an industry standard, representing data movement and transformation. It performs the following functions: </p>

<p><strong>Extract</strong> data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources</p>

<p><strong>Transform data</strong> - cleansing, reformatting, standardization, aggregate, join with other data, and apply business logic</p>

<p><strong>Load</strong> the data in specified target tables, systems, or flat files.</p>

<p>The ETL processes are reusable components that can be scheduled to perform data movement on particular time intervals. Used as batch processes, ETL jobs support massive parallel processing of data. Generally they are easy to maintain and scalable. </p>

<p>It is used for movement across systems when a high volume of data and complex business rules are involved. </p>

<h2>Big Data and the ELT approach (yes, <em>ELT</em>)</h2>

<p>Traditional data integration was performed using batch processing (data on the rest), while big data integration can be done in real-time or with batch processing. Which make the ETL phases reordered to become ELT in some cases, so the data is extracted, loaded into distributed file systems, and then transformed before being used.</p>

<h2>Commonly used ETL tools are, for example:</h2>

<ul>
<li>SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) </li>
<li>Informatica PowerCenter</li>
<li>IBM Infosphere DataStage</li>
<li>Syncsort DMX / DMX-h</li>
<li>Oracle Data Integrator</li>
<li>Oracle Warehouse Builder</li>
<li>SAS Data Management</li>
<li>CloverETL</li>

12532283,,"<p><code>encodeURIComponent</code> is a core JavaScript function, mainly used to escape special characters in strings that are going to be part of URI's query string. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var string = ""An `odd' string"",
    enc_string = encodeURIComponent(string); // === ""An%20%60odd'%20string""
</code></pre>

<p>The returned string can be safely used in URIs:</p>

<pre><code>// makes an AJAX call to request.php?string=An%20%60odd'%20string
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open(""GET"", ""request.php?string="" + enc_string, true);
xhr.onreadystatechange = callback;
xhr.send();
</code></pre>

<p><code>encodeURIComponent</code> can be used to escape query strings' keys as well.</p>

<h2>Differences with <code>escape</code> and <code>encodeURI</code></h2>

<p><code>encodeURIComponent</code> escapes special characters to the format <code>%##</code>, where <code>##</code> is the hexadecimal value of the special character's code, just like <code>escape</code> and <code>encodeURI</code>.</p>

<p>But <code>escape</code> does <em>not</em> escape characters like <code>@</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code> and <code>+</code>, with the plus commonly interpreted as a space by web servers, so it shouldn't be used when possible. Moreover, <code>escape</code> encodes Unicode characters as <code>%u####</code>, while <code>encodeURIComponent</code> first converts them to the UTF8 character sequence, then it encodes the single bytes. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var unichar = ""\u25bc"";               // A triangle pointing down
alert(escape(unichar));               // Alerts ""%u25BC""
alert(encodeURIComponent(unichar));   // Alerts ""%E2%96%BC""
</code></pre>

<p><code>encodeURI</code> behaves similarly to encodeURIComponent but it doesn't encode some other character, such as <code>/</code>, <code>&amp;</code> and <code>=</code>, as it should be used to escape whole URIs and not just parts of the query string.</p>

<h2>Usage to convert a string to UTF-8 encoding</h2>

<p>There's a nice trick to convert a string with Unicode characters to their corrisponding UTF-8 encoding:</p>

<pre><code>function toUTF8(string) {
    return unescape(encodeURIComponent(string));
}
</code></pre>

<p>There's a way to convert it back from UTF-8:</p>

<pre><code>function fromUTF8(string) {
    return decodeURIComponent(escape(string));
}
</code></pre>",,,0,,9/21/2012 14:15:00,,9/21/2012 14:24:33,9/21/2012 14:24:33,,714240,,714240,,5,0,,

  Processor runs entirely in-memory using event sourcing. The Business
  Logic Processor is surrounded by Disruptors - a concurrency component
