1754,David R. Longnecker,"<p>As an entrepreneur, I bridge the business and technology worlds to help organizations build values-aligned strategies and partnerships that include product, marketing, content, and community with a passion for innovation and iteration. These strategies focus on the people involved with technology and technology's role within an organization; not as a replacement for individuals, but as a tool to empower users, build relationships, and drive business strategy.</p>
<p>As a leader and mentor, I focus on building and enabling diverse teams driven to a core mission--the long-term success of the organization. I believe in bringing together passionate, life-long learners and providing them with the tools, opportunities, and mentoring that allows them to grow into their best selves and provide exceptional results for the organization. It’s also vital to mentor and educate across organizational boundaries and reporting chains to keep communication flowing and bring transparency and inclusion to any change agents.</p>
<p>As an application architect, my passion lies in designing and implementing right-sized solutions for customers of all sizes and keeping an eye towards process improvement, agile development, professionalism, and constant learning. Whether leading a large team or working solo, my mindset allows me to easily balance strategic and day-to-day development projects. Over the past 15 years, I've designed, developed, implemented, and integrated custom technology solutions for a wide variety of organizations and markets.</p>
<p>I thrive on technology’s constant, rapid change that provides continuous opportunities to learn, grow, and improve the organization, my peers, and myself.</p>",,8/18/2008 12:45:25,9/17/2022 3:59:37,"Kansas City, MO, USA",2767,170,2,614,https://i.stack.imgur.com/egFxf.jpg?s=128&g=1,https://drlongnecker.com

<p>(Just don't call me a &quot;full-stack&quot; engineer - there's more to software than a &quot;back-end&quot; vs. &quot;front-end&quot; dichotomy: think about embedded and robotics, industrial control, avionics, systems programming with Rust, and so on!)</p>
<p>Prior to the startup scene I was gainfully employed at Microsoft as a Software Engineer for the Chakra JavaScript engine (Edge and Internet Explorer), prior to that I worked on Expression Blend and Visual Studio.</p>
<p>I like to think I have extensive experience in C# and the .NET Framework, and modest experience in C++. Prior to Microsoft I worked on web-applications and web-services using ASP.NET Web Forms, ASP.NET MVC, and WCF. I also have experience in PHP, Java and other non-Microsoft platforms and technologies for which I'm happy to answer questions about.</p>

231500,Paul Degnan,"<p>I am Manager of the Platform Engineering team at Celmatix. I draw upon my years of experience in consumer-facing applications to lead a technology team of 10 offshore and full-time engineers to build and maintain the Polaris platform. Polaris is a HIPAA-compliant application using Ruby on Rails and React, hosted on AWS. Our technology integrates with multiple EMR systems to provide patient management tools and Celmatix proprietary patient care data to fertility clinics nationwide.</p>

<p>Previously I was head of the Software Engineering team for littleBits Electronics. There I led 3 mobile, 7 web / services, and 1 qa engineer, who built the sites and platforms supporting littleBits products. The team transitioned from primarily ecommerce / web focus, to a product development team supporting littleBits as it weaves software learning and play tools into the core of an ed-tech platform.</p>

<p>Additionally I was Director of the Development team for Marvel Interactive. There I led a team of 12 full-stack, 4 mobile, and 2 operations developers on four major project tracks to build and maintain Web properties and the Marvel Unlimited subscription product: (<a href=""http://webbyawards.com/winners/2016/mobile-sites-apps/general-sites-apps/entertainment/marvel-unlimited/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Webby Award winner 2016</a>). In addition I responded to enterprise policies and goals both from internal Marvel IT teams, and Disney enterprise shared services.</p>

<p>Before Marvel I spent over 10 years with Western Union, implementing consumer-facing bill payment systems for clients in the utilities, mortgage, insurance, and other industries, and was a developer with sixdegrees.com, an early social media platform. </p>

<p>In addition I maintain <a href=""http://www.gmap-pedometer.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.gmap-pedometer.com</a>, a tool I built in 2005 while training for the Chicago Marathon, that now averages over 600,000 visits per month. This project has garnered mention in everything from <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596101619/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O'Reilly technical books</a> to the MOMA exhibit <a href=""http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2008/elasticmind/#/98/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Design and the Elastic Mind</a></p>

<p>My goal is always to build a technology team that serves the strategy of the the business running it. Technology is my passion, and the endeavor to create an elegant and stable system is the challenge that makes the days fly by. In the end however, the right solution is one that meets the business's goals in cost, maintainability, and power.</p>",,12/14/2009 18:08:56,9/4/2022 19:54:12,"New York, United States",1902,56,3,181,,http://www.gmap-pedometer.com

With no access to the Internet or online tutorials at the time, he wrote his first game in GW-BASIC by painstakingly retyping code from a book he found at the local library.</p>

<p>A self-confessed technology geek, he has spent the time since then working on his own projects and experimenting with every new language and technology that he could. During this time he became well known for single-handedly re-creating the famous Command and Conquer RTS game entirely in HTML5.

<p>Apart from programming, Aditya is passionate about billiards, salsa dancing, and learning to develop the subconscious mind. He maintains a personal website (www.adityaravishankar.com) where he writes articles on game programming, personal development, and billiards. </p>
