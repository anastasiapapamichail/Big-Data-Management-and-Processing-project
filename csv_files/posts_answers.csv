<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Objects can have symbolic properties that can not be returned via Object.key method. So the answer would be incomplete without mentioning them.</p>
<p>Symbol type was added to the language to create unique identifiers for object properties. The main benefit of the Symbol type is the prevention of overwrites.</p>
<p><code>Object.keys</code> or <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames</code> does not work for symbolic properties. To return them you need to use <code>Object.getOwnPropertySymbols</code>.</p>

12241,,"<p>Look, there's no easy way to do this.  I'm working on a project that is inherently multithreaded.  Events come in from the operating system and I have to process them concurrently.</p>
<p>The simplest way to deal with testing complex, multithreaded application code is this:  If it's too complex to test, you're doing it wrong.  If you have a single instance that has multiple threads acting upon it, and you can't test situations where these threads step all over each other, then your design needs to be redone.  It's both as simple and as complex as this.</p>
<p>There are many ways to program for multithreading that avoids threads running through instances at the same time.  The simplest is to make all your objects immutable.  Of course, that's not usually possible.  So you have to identify those places in your design where threads interact with the same instance and reduce the number of those places.  By doing this, you isolate a few classes where multithreading actually occurs, reducing the overall complexity of testing your system.</p>
<p>But you have to realize that even by doing this, you still can't test every situation where two threads step on each other.  To do that, you'd have to run two threads concurrently in the same test, then control exactly what lines they are executing at any given moment.  The best you can do is simulate this situation.  But this might require you to code specifically for testing, and that's at best a half step towards a true solution.</p>
<p>Probably the best way to test code for threading issues is through static analysis of the code.  If your threaded code doesn't follow a finite set of thread safe patterns, then you might have a problem.  I believe Code Analysis in VS does contain some knowledge of threading, but probably not much.</p>
<p>Look, as things stand currently (and probably will stand for a good time to come), the best way to test multithreaded apps is to reduce the complexity of threaded code as much as possible.

<p>The first style would plan everything in to steps, and solves the problem by implementing one step (a procedure) at a time. On the other hand, functional programming would emphasize the divide-and-conquer approach, where the problem is divided into sub-problem, then each sub-problem is solved (creating a function to solve that sub problem) and the results are combined to create the answer for the whole problem. Lastly, Objective programming would mimic the real world by create a mini-world inside the computer with many objects, each of which has a (somewhat) unique characteristics, and interacts with others.

33707,,"<p>GPS, the Global Positioning System run by the United States Military, is free for civilian use, though the reality is that we're paying for it with tax dollars.</p>

<p>However, GPS on cell phones is a bit more murky.  In general, it won't cost you anything to turn on the GPS in your cell phone, but when you get a location it usually involves the cell phone company in order to get it quickly with little signal, as well as get a location when the satellites aren't visible (since the gov't requires a fix even if the satellites aren't visible for emergency 911 purposes).  It uses up some cellular bandwidth.  This also means that for phones without a regular GPS receiver, you cannot use the GPS at all if you don't have cell phone service.</p>

<p>For this reason most cell phone companies have the GPS in the phone turned off except for emergency calls and for services they sell you (such as directions).</p>

<p>This particular kind of GPS is called assisted GPS (AGPS), and there are several levels of assistance used.</p>

<h2>GPS</h2>

<p>A normal GPS receiver listens to a particular frequency for radio signals.  Satellites send time coded messages at this frequency.  Each satellite has an atomic clock, and sends the current exact time as well.</p>

<p>The GPS receiver figures out which satellites it can hear, and then starts gathering those messages.  The messages include time, current satellite positions, and a few other bits of information.  The message stream is slow - this is to save power, and also because all the satellites transmit on the same frequency and they're easier to pick out if they go slow.  Because of this, and the amount of information needed to operate well, it can take 30-60 seconds to get a location on a regular GPS.</p>

<p>When it knows the position and time code of at least 3 satellites, a GPS receiver can assume it's on the earth's surface and get a good reading.  4 satellites are needed if you aren't on the ground and you want altitude as well.</p>

<h2>AGPS</h2>

<p>As you saw above, it can take a long time to get a position fix with a normal GPS.  There are ways to speed this up, but unless you're carrying an atomic clock with you all the time, or leave the GPS on all the time, then there's always going to be a delay of between 5-60 seconds before you get a location.</p>

<p>In order to save cost, most cell phones share the GPS receiver components with the cellular components, and you can't get a fix and talk at the same time.  People don't like that (especially when there's an emergency) so the lowest form of GPS does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Get some information from the cell phone company to feed to the GPS receiver - some of this is gross positioning information based on what cellular towers can 'hear' your phone, so by this time they already phone your location to within a city block or so.</li>
<li>Switch from cellular to GPS receiver for 0.1 second (or some small, practically unoticable period of time) and collect the raw GPS data (no processing on the phone).</li>
<li>Switch back to the phone mode, and send the raw data to the phone company</li>
<li>The phone company processes that data (acts as an offline GPS receiver) and send the location back to your phone.</li>
</ol>

<p>This saves a lot of money on the phone design, but it has a heavy load on cellular bandwidth, and with a lot of requests coming it requires a lot of fast servers.  Still, overall it can be cheaper and faster to implement.  They are reluctant, however, to release GPS based features on these phones due to this load - so you won't see turn by turn navigation here.</p>

<p>More recent designs include a full GPS chip.  They still get data from the phone company - such as current location based on tower positioning, and current satellite locations - this provides sub 1 second fix times.  This information is only needed once, and the GPS can keep track of everything after that with very little power.  If the cellular network is unavailable, then they can still get a fix after awhile.  If the GPS satellites aren't visible to the receiver, then they can still get a rough fix from the cellular towers.</p>

<p>But to completely answer your question - it's as free as the phone company lets it be, and so far they do not charge for it at all.  I doubt that's going to change in the future.  In the higher end phones with a full GPS receiver you may even be able to load your own software and access it, such as with mologogo on a motorola iDen phone - the J2ME development kit is free, and the phone is only $40 (prepaid phone with $5 credit).  Unlimited internet is about $10 a month, so for $40 to start and $10 a month you can get an internet tracking system. (Prices circa August 2008)</p>

<p>It's only going to get cheaper and more full featured from here on out...</p>

<p>Re: Google maps and such</p>

<p>Yes, Google maps and all other cell phone mapping systems require a data connection of some sort at varying times during usage.  When you move far enough in one direction, for instance, it'll request new tiles from its server.  Your average phone doesn't have enough storage to hold a map of the US, nor the processor power to render it nicely. iPhone would be able to if you wanted to use the storage space up with maps, but given that most iPhones have a full time unlimited data plan most users would rather use that space for other things.</p>",,,1,,8/29/2008 0:36:45,,2/27/2016 15:12:04,2/27/2016 15:12:04,Adam Davis,229044,Adam Davis,,33637,2,56,,

<p>From your code fragment, I can surmise that you think that you can copy function's compiled code into a block of memory, and then reuse it. This kind of thing smells of Lisp, except even in lisp you don't do it that way.</p>

<p>In fact, when you say ""&amp;isNot"", you get a pointer to function. Copying the memory that pointer points at is counterproductive - the memory was initialized when you loaded your executable into memory, and it's not changing. In any case, writing someFunc() would cause a core dump, as the heap memory behing someFunc cannot be executed - this protects you from all sorts of viruses.</p>

<p>You seem to expect an implementation of closures in C. That implementation is simply not there. Unlike Lisp or Perl or Ruby, C cannot preserve elements of a stack frame once you exited that frame. Even is nested functions are permitted in some compilers, I am sure that you cannot refer to non-global variables from inside those functions. The closes thing to closures is indeed C++ object that stores the state and implements operator(), but it's a completely different approach, and you'd still have to do things manually.</p>

<li>Mail the remainder of the CC# to whoever processes your transactions (probably yourself) with the ID of the person to process.</li>
<li>When you log in later, you will type in the ID and the mailed-out portion of the CC#. Your system can decrypt the other portion and recombine to get the full number so you can process the transaction.</li>
<li>Finally, delete the online record. My paranoid solution was to overwrite the record with random data before deletion, to remove the possibility of an undelete.</li>

  <p>The zero-initialization (<em>dcl.init</em>) of all local objects with 
  static storage  duration  (<em>basic.stc.static</em>) is performed before
  any other initialization  takes   place. A   local  object of 
  POD type (<em>basic.types</em>)  with static  storage  duration
  initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its
  block is first entered. An implementation  is  permitted to perform
  early initialization of other local objects with static storage
  duration under the same conditions that an implementation is
  permitted to statically initialize an object with static storage
  duration in namespace scope  (<em>basic.start.init</em>). Otherwise  such
  an object is initialized the first time control passes through its
  declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon the
  completion of its initialization. If the initialization exits by 
  throwing an exception, the initialization is not complete, so it will
  be  tried again the next time control enters the declaration.  If control re-enters the declaration (recursively) while the object is being
  initialized, the behavior is undefined.  [<em>Example:</em></p>

<pre><code>      int foo(int i)
      {
          static int s = foo(2*i);  // recursive call - undefined
          return i+1;
      }

  <p>The destructor for a local object with static storage duration will
  be   executed  if  and  only  if  the  variable  was  constructed.

  objects with   static storage duration are destroyed.  ]</p>

<h2><a href=""https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean"" rel=""noreferrer"">git-clean</a> - Remove untracked files from the working tree</h2>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<pre><code>git clean [-d] [-f] [-i] [-n] [-q] [-e &lt;pattern&gt;] [-x | -X] [--] &lt;path&gt;…​
</code></pre>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, <strong>starting from the current directory</strong>.</p>
<p>Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the <code>-x</code> option is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products.</p>
<p>If any optional <code>&lt;path&gt;...</code> arguments are given, only those paths are affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Step 1 is to show what will be deleted by using the <code>-n</code> option:</p>
<pre><code># Print out the list of files and directories which will be removed (dry run)
git clean -n -d
</code></pre>
<p>Clean Step - <strong>beware: this will delete files</strong>:</p>
<pre><code># Delete the files from the repository
git clean -f
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>To remove directories, run <code>git clean -f -d</code> or <code>git clean -fd</code></li>
<li>To remove ignored files, run <code>git clean -f -X</code> or <code>git clean -fX</code></li>
<li>To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run <code>git clean -f -x</code> or <code>git clean -fx</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong> the case difference on the <code>X</code> for the two latter commands.</p>
<p>If <code>clean.requireForce</code> is set to &quot;true&quot; (the default) in your configuration, one needs to specify <code>-f</code> otherwise nothing will actually happen.</p>
<p>Again see the <a href=""http://git-scm.com/docs/git-clean"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>git-clean</code></a> docs for more information.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h3>Options</h3>
<p><strong><code>-f</code>, <code>--force</code></strong></p>
<p>If the Git configuration variable clean.requireForce is not set to
false, git clean will refuse to run unless given <code>-f</code>, <code>-n</code> or <code>-i</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>-x</code></strong></p>
<p>Don’t use the standard ignore rules read from .gitignore (per
directory) and <code>$GIT_DIR/info/exclude</code>, but do still use the ignore
rules given with <code>-e</code> options. This allows removing all untracked files,
including build products. This can be used (possibly in conjunction
with git reset) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean
build.</p>
<p><strong><code>-X</code></strong></p>
<p>Remove only files ignored by Git. This may be useful to rebuild
everything from scratch, but keep manually created files.</p>
<p><strong><code>-n</code>, <code>--dry-run</code></strong></p>
<p>Don’t actually remove anything, just show what would be done.</p>
<p><strong><code>-d</code></strong></p>
<p>Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files. If an
untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is
not removed by default. Use <code>-f</code> option twice if you really want to
remove such a directory.</p>

<p>Features I like: </p>

<p>Control+1 for error fixing - it knows how to fix most compile errors - just highlight the error in the code (which will be underlined in red) and it will give you a list of suggestions. Control+1 selects the first suggestion, which is almost always correct.</p>

<p>You can use this error fixing feature to write code that uses methods you haven't written yet - the error fixing will create the method on the class/interface you called it on, with the correct parameters/name/visibility etc. Or, if theres a similarly named method with similar parameters, it will suggest you've spelt it wrong when you called it.</p>

<p>The refactoring tools are also supergreat - you can highlight a block of code to extract as a method, and it'll work out what variables need to be passed in, and what it should return (if anything). You can move variables between field and methods. You can change class/interface/variable names, and it will correct them only where it needs to (which beats a search and replace any day).</p>

<p>You really don't need to know many eclipse features to get the benefit of using it - and it'll dramatically speed up your coding. I wish I'd known how to use it at University.</p>

<ol>
<li>Wrap command-line programs</li>
<li>use a Python library that provides SSH capabilities (eg - <a href=""https://www.paramiko.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Paramiko</a> or <a href=""https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedConch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Twisted Conch</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>Each approach has its own quirks. You will need to setup SSH keys to enable password-less logins if you are wrapping system commands like &quot;ssh&quot;, &quot;scp&quot; or &quot;rsync.&quot; You can embed a password in a script using Paramiko or some other library, but you might find the lack of documentation frustrating, especially if you are not familiar with the basics of the SSH connection (eg - key exchanges, agents, etc). It probably goes without saying that SSH keys are almost always a better idea than passwords for this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>NOTE: its hard to beat rsync if you plan on transferring files via SSH, especially if the alternative is plain old scp.</p>
<p>I've used Paramiko with an eye towards replacing system calls but found myself drawn back to the wrapped commands due to their ease of use and immediate familiarity. You might be different. I gave Conch the once-over some time ago but it didn't appeal to me.</p>

<p>We have a list looking like: ... -> Node(i-1) -> Node(i) -> Node(i+1) -> ... and we need to delete Node(i).</p>

<li>Copy data (not pointer, the data itself) from Node(i+1) to Node(i), the list will look like:  ... -> Node(i-1) -> Node(i+1) -> Node(i+1) -> ...</li>

76919,,"<p>SOAP is useful from a tooling perspective because the WSDL is so easily consumed by tools.  So, you can get Web Service clients generated for you in your favorite language.</p>

<p>REST plays well with AJAX'y web pages.  If you keep your requests simple, you can make service calls directly from your JavaScript, and that comes in very handy.  Try to stay away from having any namespaces in your response XML, I've seen browsers choke on those.  So, xsi:type is probably not going to work for you, no overly complex XML Schemas.</p>

<p>REST tends to have better performance as well.  CPU requirements of the code generating REST responses tend to be lower than what SOAP frameworks exhibit.  And, if you have your XML generation ducks lined up on the server side, you can effectively stream XML out to the client.  So, imagine you're reading rows of database cursor.  As you read a row, you format it as an XML element, and you write that directly out to the service consumer.  This way, you don't have to collect all of the database rows in memory before starting to write your XML output - you read and write at the same time.  Look into novel templating engines or XSLT to get the streaming to work for REST.</p>

<p>SOAP on the other hand tends to get generated by tool-generated services as a big blob and only then written.  This is not an absolute truth, mind you, there are ways to get streaming characteristics out of SOAP, like by using attachments.  </p>

<p>My decision making process is as follows:  if I want my service to be easily tooled by consumers, and the messages I write will be medium-to-small-ish (10MB or less), and I don't mind burning some extra CPU cycles on the server, I go with SOAP.  If I need to serve to AJAX on web browsers, or I need the thing to stream, or my responses are gigantic, I go REST.</p>

77610,,"<p>I would make it a three step process with a slight temporary modification to your SpeciesFoundInCountry table.  I would add a column to that table to store the Country name.  Then the steps would be as follows.</p>

<p>1) Create/Run a script that walks columns in the source table and creates a record in SpeciesFoundInCountry for each column that has a true value. This record would contain the country name.
2) Run a SQL statement that updates the SpeciesFoundInCountry.CountryID field by joining to the Country table on Country Name.
3) Cleanup the SpeciesFoundInCountry table by removing the CountryName column.</p>

<p>Here is a little MS Access VB/VBA pseudo code to give you the gist</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub CreateRelationshipRecords()

  Dim rstSource as DAO.Recordset
  Dim rstDestination as DAO.Recordset
  Dim fld as DAO.Field
  dim strSQL as String
  Dim lngSpeciesID as Long

  strSQL = ""SELECT * FROM [ORIGINALTABLE]""
  Set rstSource = CurrentDB.OpenRecordset(strSQL)
  set rstDestination = CurrentDB.OpenRecordset(""SpeciesFoundInCountry"")

  rstSource.MoveFirst

  ' Step through each record in the original table
  Do Until rstSource.EOF
    lngSpeciesID = rstSource.ID
    ' Now step through the fields(columns). If the field
    ' value is one (1), then create a relationship record
    ' using the field name as the Country Name
    For Each fld in rstSource.Fields
      If fld.Value = 1 then
        with rstDestination
          .AddNew
          .Fields(""CountryID"").Value = Null
          .Fields(""CountryName"").Value = fld.Name
          .Fields(""SpeciesID"").Value = lngSpeciesID
          .Update
        End With
      End IF
    Next fld  
    rstSource.MoveNext
  Loop

  ' Clean up
  rstSource.Close
  Set rstSource = nothing
  ....

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>After this you could run a simple SQL statement to update the CountryID values in the SpeciesFoundInCountry table.</p>

<p>UPDATE SpeciesFoundInCountry INNER JOIN Country ON SpeciesFoundInCountry.CountryName = Country.CountryName SET SpeciesFoundInCountry.CountryID = Country.CountryID;</p>

<p>Finally, all you have to do is cleanup the SpeciesFoundInCountry table by removing the CountryName column.</p>

<p>****SIDE NOTE:  I have found it usefull to have country tables that also include the ISO abbreviations (country codes).  Occassionally they are used as Foreign Keys in other tables so that a join to the Country table does not have to be included in queries.</p>

78918,,"<p>Man do I have experience with this. I work on a project where we originally stored all of our data using XML, then moved to SQLite. There are many pros and cons to each technology, but it was performance that caused the switchover. Here is what we observed.</p>
<p>For small databases (a few meg or smaller), XML was much faster, and easier to deal with. Our data was naturally in a tree format, which made XML much more attractive, and XPath allowed us to do many queries in one simple line rather than having to walk down an ancestry tree.</p>
<p>We were programming in a Win32 environment, and used the standard Microsoft DOM library. We would load all the data into memory, parse it into a DOM tree and search, add, modify on the in memory copy. We would periodically save the data, and needed to rotate copies in case the machine crashed in the middle of a write.</p>
<p>We also needed to build up some &quot;indexes&quot; by hand using C++ tree maps. This, of course would be trivial to do with SQL.</p>
<p>Note that the size of the data on the filesystem was a factor of 2-4 smaller than the &quot;in memory&quot; DOM tree.</p>
<p>By the time the data got to 10M-100M size, we started to have real problems. Interestingly enough, at all data sizes, XML processing was much faster than SQLite turned out to be (because it was in memory, not on the hard drive)! The problem was actually twofold- first, loadup time really started to get long. We would need to wait a minute or so before the data was in memory and the maps were built. Of course once loaded the program was very fast. The second problem was that all of this memory was tied up all the time. Systems with only a few hundred meg would be unresponsive in other apps even though we ran very fast.</p>
<p>We actually looking into using a filesystem based XML database. There are a couple open sourced versions XML databases, we tried them. I have never tried to use a commercial XML database, so I can't comment on them. Unfortunately, we could never get the XML databases to work well at all. Even the act of populating the database with hundreds of meg of XML took hours.... Perhaps we were using it incorrectly. Another problem was that these databases were pretty heavyweight. They required Java and had full client server architecture. We gave up on this idea.</p>
<p>We found SQLite then. It solved our problems, but at a price. When we initially plugged SQLite in, the memory and load time problems were gone. Unfortunately, since all processing was now done on the harddrive, the background processing load went way up. While earlier we never even noticed the CPU load, now the processor usage was way up. We needed to optimize the code, and still needed to keep some data in memory. We also needed to rewrite many simple XPath queries as complicated multiquery algorithms.</p>
<p>So here is a summary of what we learned.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>For tree data, XML is much easier to query and modify using XPath.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For small datasets (less than 10M), XML blew away SQLite in performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For large datasets (greater than 10M-100M), XML load time and memory usage became a big problem, to the point that some computers become unusable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We couldn't get any opensource XML database to fix the problems associated with large datasets.</p>
</li>
<li><p>SQLite doesn't have the memory problems of XML DOM, but it is generally slower in processing the data (it is on the hard drive, not in memory). (note- SQLite tables can be stored in memory, perhaps this would make it as fast.... We didn't try this because we wanted to get the data out of memory.)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Storing and querying tree data in a table is not enjoyable. However, managing transactions and indexing partially makes up for it.</p>

For example, if your exception handler displays a dialog with the exception message, if you're out of memory, there may not be enough left for the dialog display. Best to log it and shut down immediately.</p>

88226,,"<p>A tried and tested way I have used is to design a settings container class. 
This container class can have sub-classes for different types of setting categories.
It works well since you reference your ""settings"" via property name and therefore if something changes in future, you will get compile time errors. It is also expandible, since you can always create new settings by adding more properties to your individual setting classes and assign default values to the private variable of a property that will be used should that specific setting not exist in an older version of your application. Once the new container is saved, the new settings will be persisted as well.
Another advantage is the obvious human / computer readability of XML which is nice for settings. </p>

<p>To save, serialize the container object to XML data, then write the data to file. To load, read the data from file and deserialize back into your settings container class.</p>

<p>To serialize via standard C# code:</p>

<pre><code>public static string SerializeToXMLString(object ObjectToSerialize)
MemoryStream mem = new MemoryStream();          
System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer ser = new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(ObjectToSerialize.GetType());
ser.Serialize(mem,ObjectToSerialize);                       
ASCIIEncoding ascii = new ASCIIEncoding();
return ascii.GetString(mem.ToArray());
</code></pre>

<p>To deserialize via standard C# code:</p>

<pre><code>public static object DeSerializeFromXMLString(System.Type TypeToDeserialize, string xmlString)
byte[] bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(xmlString);
MemoryStream mem = new MemoryStream(bytes);         
System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer ser = new System.Xml.Serialization.XmlSerializer(TypeToDeserialize);
return ser.Deserialize(mem);
</code></pre>

<p>Note: After you instantiated your settings container class, you should make it a static property of another static managing class (you can call it SettingsManager if you want)
This managing class allows you to access your settings from anywhere in your application (since its static) and you can also have static functions to handle the loading and saving of the class.</p>",,,3,,9/17/2008 22:12:42,,6/13/2013 19:43:09,6/13/2013 19:43:09,,606910,Poltergoose,,88030,2,0,,

<p>You need to add the following to your server side link/button:</p>

<pre><code>OnClientClick=""aspnetForm.target ='_blank';""
</code></pre>

<p>My entire button code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:LinkButton ID=""myButton"" runat=""server"" Text=""Click Me!"" 
                OnClick=""myButton_Click"" 
                OnClientClick=""aspnetForm.target ='_blank';""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the server side OnClick I do a <code>Response.Redirect(""MyPage.aspx"");</code> and the page is opened in a new window.</p>

<p>The other part you need to add is to fix the form's target otherwise every link will open in a new window. To do so add the following in the header of your POPUP window.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function fixform() {
        if (opener.document.getElementById(""aspnetForm"").target != ""_blank"") return;
        opener.document.getElementById(""aspnetForm"").target = """";
        opener.document.getElementById(""aspnetForm"").action = opener.location.href;
    }

<p>A second way is that you want to preserve the aspect ration of all the images, but scale the display size to a sane value.  There is a way to access this in JavaScript, but I'll need a bit to write up a quick code sample.</p>

<p>The third way, and I hope you don't mean this way, is to alter the actual size of the image.  This is something you'd have to do on the server side, as not only is JavaScript unable to create images, but it wouldn't make any sense, as the full sized image has already been sent.</p>",,,1,,9/20/2008 2:42:16,,08/08/2017 23:29,08/08/2017 23:29,,6087962,Languard,,106828,2,0,,

<p>void clearDeleted();</p>

<p>bool isDeleted();</p>

<p>etc... (or whatever convention suits)</p>

<p>It could validate combinations (in the case where not all combinations are legal, eg if 'new' and 'deleted' could not both be set at the same time).  If you just used bit masks etc then the code that sets the state needs to validate, a class can encapsulate that logic too.  </p>

<p>The class may also give you the ability to attach meaningful logging info to each state, you could add a function to return a string representation of the current state etc (or use the streaming operators '&lt;&lt;').  </p>

<p>For all that if you are worried about storage you could still have the class only have a 'char' data member, so only take a small amount of storage (assuming it is non virtual).  Of course depending on the hardware etc you may have alignment issues. </p>

<p>You could have the actual bit values not visible to the rest of the 'world' if they are in an anonymous namespace inside the cpp file rather than in the header file.</p>

<p>The problem is that the original .webpart file was created on a 32-bit system with Visual Studio Extensions for WSS installed.</p>

<p>However as I'm now on a 64-bit machine VSEWSS is unavailable, and I believe that results in the above GUID not being substituted as I am not using those deployment tools.</p>

<p>Replacing the GUID with the full type name works.</p>

<p>So if you encounter the error message from your importErrorMessage node, then check that your type node in the .webpart file looks more like this (unrelated example):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;type name=""TitleWP.TitleWP, TitleWP, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=9f4da00116c38ec5"" /&gt;

<p>Think of it this way: You want to share data with someone in the cube next to you, so you pull out your flash stick and copy/paste. You walk next door and the guy says ""is that USB?"" and you say yes - all set. It doesn't matter the size of the flash stick, nor the maker - all that matters is that it's USB.</p>

<p>In the same way, interfaces allow you to generisize your development. Using another analogy - imagine you wanted to create an application that virtually painted cars. You might have a signature like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void Paint(Car car, System.Drawing.Color color)...
</code></pre>

<p>This would work until your client said ""now I want to paint trucks"" so you could do this:</p>

<pre><code>public void Paint (Vehicle vehicle, System.Drawing.Color color)...

<p>this would broaden your app... until your client said ""now I want to paint houses!"" What you could have done from the very beginning is created an interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IPaintable{

<p>...and passed that to your routine:</p>

<pre><code>public void Paint(IPaintable item, System.Drawing.Color color){

126507,,"<p>Greg's profile results are great for the exact scenario he covered, but interestingly, the relative costs of the different methods change dramatically when considering a number of different factors including the number of types being compared, and the relative frequency and any patterns in the underlying data.</p>

<p>The simple answer is that nobody can tell you what the performance difference is going to be in your specific scenario, you will need to measure the performance in different ways yourself in your own system to get an accurate answer.</p>

<p>The If/Else chain is an effective approach for a small number of type comparisons, or if you can reliably predict which few types are going to make up the majority of the ones that you see.  The potential problem with the approach is that as the number of types increases, the number of comparisons that must be executed increases as well.</p>

<p>if I execute the following:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>int value = 25124;
if(value == 0) ...
else if (value == 1) ...
else if (value == 2) ...
...
else if (value == 25124) ... 
</code></pre>

<p>each of the previous if conditions must be evaluated before the correct block is entered.  On the other hand</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>switch(value) {
 case 0:...break;
 case 1:...break;
 case 2:...break;
 ...
 case 25124:...break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>will perform one simple jump to the correct bit of code.</p>

<p>Where it gets more complicated in your example is that your other method uses a switch on strings rather than integers which gets a little more complicated.  At a low level, strings can't be switched on in the same way that integer values can so the C# compiler does some magic to make this work for you.  </p>

<p>If the switch statement is ""small enough"" (where the compiler does what it thinks is best automatically) switching on strings generates code that is the same as an if/else chain.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>switch(someString) {
    case ""Foo"": DoFoo(); break;
    case ""Bar"": DoBar(); break;
    default: DoOther; break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>if(someString == ""Foo"") {
    DoFoo();
} else if(someString == ""Bar"") {
    DoBar();
} else {
    DoOther();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once the list of items in the dictionary gets ""big enough"" the compiler will automatically create an internal dictionary that maps from the strings in the switch to an integer index and then a switch based on that index.</p>

<p>It looks something like this (Just imagine more entries than I am going to bother to type)</p>

<p>A static field is defined in a ""hidden"" location that is associated with the class containing the switch statement of type <code>Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;</code> and given a mangled name </p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>//Make sure the dictionary is loaded
if(theDictionary == null) { 
    //This is simplified for clarity, the actual implementation is more complex 
    // in order to ensure thread safety
    theDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string,int&gt;();
    theDictionary[""Foo""] = 0;
    theDictionary[""Bar""] = 1;
}

int switchIndex;
if(theDictionary.TryGetValue(someString, out switchIndex)) {
    switch(switchIndex) {
    case 0: DoFoo(); break;
    case 1: DoBar(); break;
    }
} else {
    DoOther();
}
</code></pre>

<p>In some quick tests that I just ran, the If/Else method is about 3x as fast as the switch for 3 different types (where the types are randomly distributed).  At 25 types the switch is faster by a small margin (16%) at 50 types the switch is more than twice as fast.</p>

<p>If you are going to be switching on a large number of types, I would suggest a 3rd method:</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>private delegate void NodeHandler(ChildNode node);

static Dictionary&lt;RuntimeTypeHandle, NodeHandler&gt; TypeHandleSwitcher = CreateSwitcher();

private static Dictionary&lt;RuntimeTypeHandle, NodeHandler&gt; CreateSwitcher()
{
    var ret = new Dictionary&lt;RuntimeTypeHandle, NodeHandler&gt;();

    ret[typeof(Bob).TypeHandle] = HandleBob;
    ret[typeof(Jill).TypeHandle] = HandleJill;
    ret[typeof(Marko).TypeHandle] = HandleMarko;

    return ret;
}

void HandleChildNode(ChildNode node)
{
    NodeHandler handler;
    if (TaskHandleSwitcher.TryGetValue(Type.GetRuntimeType(node), out handler))
    {
        handler(node);
    }
    else
    {
        //Unexpected type...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to what Ted Elliot suggested, but the usage of runtime type handles instead of full type objects avoids the overhead of loading the type object through reflection.</p>

<p>Here are some quick timings on my machine:</p>

<p>On my machine at least, the type handle dictionary approach beats all of the others for anything over 15 different types when the distribution
of the types used as input to the method is random.  </p>

<p>If on the other hand, the input is composed entirely of the type that is checked first in the if/else chain that method is <em>much</em> faster:</p>

Testing 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=UniformFirst) and 50 types

Each new check in can be a new version, it can compare any version to any other version and even to what is in your database at that time. It will then present a list of every difference and ask which should be migrated… and then it builds the script to do it. It’s not cheap but it’s a bargain at twice the price and it’s ROI is about 6 months.</p>

<p>The other idea is to turn on DDL auditing (works in Oracle). This will create a table with every change you make. If you query the changes from the timestamp you last moved your database changes to prod to right now, you’ll have an ordered list of everything you’ve done. A few where clauses to eliminate zero-sum changes like create table foo; followed by drop table foo; and you can EASILY build a mod script. Why keep the changes in a wiki, that’s double the work.

<p>First, the comment about Amazon, ASINs and ISBN numbers is wrong in a number of ways. In almost every circumstance where a book has an ISBN, the ASIN and the ISBN are the same. ISBNs are not now 13 digits. Rather, ISBNs can be either 10 or 13. Ten-digit ISBNs can be expressed as 13-digit ones starting with 978, which means every ISBN currently in existence has both a 10- and a 13-digit form. There are all sorts of libraries available for converting between ISBN10 and ISBN13. Basically, you add 978 to the front and recalculate the checksum digit at the end.</p>

<p>ISBN13 was invented because publishers were running out of ISBNs. In the near future, when 979-based ISBN13s start being used, they will not have an ISBN10 equivalent. To my knowledge, there are no published books with 979-based ISBNs, but they are coming soon. Anyway, the long and short of it is that Amazon uses the ISBN10 form for all 978 ISBN10s. In any case, whether or not Amazon uses ten or thirteen-digit ASINs, you can search Amazon by either just fine.</p>

<p>Personally, I wouldn't put ISBN DB at the top of your list. ISBN DB mines from a number of sources, but it's not as comprehensive as Amazon or Google. Rather, I'd look into Amazon—including the various international Amazons—and then the new Google Book Data API and, after that, the OpenLibrary API. For non-English books, there are other options, like Ozone for Russian books. </p>

<p>If you care about the highest-quality data, or if you have any books published before about 1970, you will want to look into data from libraries, available by Z39.50 protocol and usually in MARC format, or, with a few libraries in Dublin Core, using the SRU/SRW protocol. MARC format is, to a modern programmer, pretty strange stuff. But, once you get it, it's also better data and includes useful fields like the LCCN, DDC, LCC, and LCSH.</p>

<p>LibraryThing runs off a homemade Python library that queries some 680 libraries and converts the many flavors of MARC into Amazon-compatible XML, with extras. We are currently reluctant to release the code, but maybe releasing a service soon.</p>",,,2,,9/30/2008 3:00:03,,09/07/2018 16:20,09/07/2018 16:20,,367878,Tim Spalding,,41469,2,44,,

152464,,"<p>JavaScript is a prototype-based programming language (probably prototype-based scripting language is more correct definition). It employs cloning and not inheritance. A prototype-based programming language is a style of object-oriented programming without classes. While object-oriented programming languages encourages development focus on taxonomy and relationships, prototype-based programming languages encourages to focus on behavior first and then later classify.</p>

<p>The term “object-oriented” was coined by Alan Kay in 1967, who explains it in 2003 to mean  </p>

<blockquote>

<p>In object-oriented programming, each object is capable of receiving messages, processing data, and sending messages to other objects.</p>

<p>For a language to be object-oriented in may include features as encapsulation, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance, but it is not a requirement. Object-oriented programming languages that make use of classes are often referred to as classed-based programming languages, but it is by no means a must to make use of classes to be object-oriented.</p>

<p>JavaScript uses prototypes to define object properties, including methods and inheritance.</p>

<p>If you've implemented ClearCase (CC) using an SVN-type model, then SVN will work just fine and be a <em>lot</em> cheaper.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you use deferred branching, build-by-label, and dynamic views (or can), which we use to great advantage in saving time and effort, and improving reliability, you will seriously regret losing these features. (Not to mention build management, UCM, etc.)</p>

<p>I find most people use the first choice, which is like using a Ferrari in rush hour traffic...</p>

<p>Example?
Define labels GA, SP1, SP2 (you can have as many releases between GA and SP1 as you like, not relevant, and remember, CC labels are NOT the same as SVN).
GA was your base release,
SP1 is your current release.
SP2 is your next release.
The current release is based on GA and SP1.
The next release is based on GA, SP1, and SP2 (see CC config specs)</p>

<p>Begin QA.
Development is doing ongoing work for the ""next release"", and users can reference (not change) GA and SP1, and can apply SP2.
Maintenance is doing work to repair defects found by QA and can reference GA, and apply SP1.</p>

<p>Case 1:
In ClearCase, the mere act of applying the SP1 label makes the fix automatically available to the Dev SP2 release team. No work. Nada, Zero.</p>

<p>In Subversion, you would be making the change on a QA branch, and then (hopefully, remember to) migrate the change to SP2.</p>

<p>Case 2:
Before you ask, certainly, if you add an SP2 change, you will have to branch to add a subsequent change for SP1, as it would be in most systems.</p>

<p>In my world, real world numbers: 
Case 1 happened 122 times for my last SP (8 SPs per year).
Over 800 changes per year I didn't have to make in ClearCase I would have had to make if I used the Subversion model.</p>

<p>Case 2 has happened 6 times since early 2002 when we installed CC.</p>

<p>The kernel is not ""allowed"" a time slice. The kernel is the thing that gives out time slices to user processes. The ""timer"" is not set to wake the sleeping process up - it is set to stop the currently running process.</p>

<p>In essence, the kernel attempts to fairly distribute the CPU time by stopping processes that are on CPU too long. For a simplified picture, let's say that no process is allowed to use the CPU more than 2 milliseconds. So, the kernel would set timer to 2 milliseconds, and let the process run. When the timer fires an interrupt, the kernel gets control. It saves the running process' current state (registers, instruction pointer and so on), and the control is not returned to it. Instead, another process is picked from the list of processes waiting to be given CPU, and the process that was interrupted goes to the back of the queue.</p>

<p>The sleeping process is simply <em>not</em> in the queue of things waiting for CPU. Instead, it's stored in the sleeping queue. Whenever kernel gets timer interrupt, the sleep queue is checked, and the processes whose time have come get transferred to ""waiting for CPU"" queue.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a gross simplification. It takes very sophisticated algorithms to ensure security, fairness, balance, prioritize, prevent starvation, do it all fast and with minimum amount of memory used for kernel data.</p>",,,2,,10/07/2008 15:22,,04/06/2013 15:03,04/06/2013 15:03,,2203010,user3458,,175882,2,43,,

182447,,"<p>For myself one of the main reasons to use an IoC (and make use of external configuration) is around the two areas of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Testing</li>
<li>Production maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Testing</strong></p>

<p>If you split your testing into 3 scenarios (which is fairly normal in large scale development):</p>

<ol>
<li>Unit testing</li>
<li>Integration testing</li>
<li>Black box testing</li>
</ol>

<p>What you will want to do is for the last two test scenarios (Integration &amp; Black box), is not recompile any part of the application.</p>

<p>If any of your test scenarios require you to change the configuration (ie: use another component to mimic a banking integration, or do a performance load), this can be easily handled (this does come under the benefits of configuring the DI side of an IoC though.</p>

<p>Additionally if your app is used either at multiple sites (with different server and component configuration) or has a changing configuration on the live environment you can use the later stages of testing to verify that the app will handle those changes.</p>

<p><strong>Production</strong></p>

<p>As a developer you don't (and should not) have control of the production environment (in particular when your app is being distributed to multiple customers or seperate sites), this to me is the real benefit of using both an IoC and external configuration, as it is up to the infrastructure/production support to tweak and adjust the live environment without having to go back to developers and through test (higher cost when all they want to do is move a component).</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>The main benefits that external configuration of an IoC come from giving others (non-developers) the power to configure your application, in my experience this is only useful under a limited set of circumstances:</p>

<ul>
<li>Application is distributed to multiple sites/clients where environments will differ.</li>
<li>Limited development control/input over the production environment and setup.</li>
<li>Testing scenarios.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice I've found that even when developing something that you do have control over the environment it will be run on, over time it is better to give someone else the capabilities to change the configuration:</p>

<ul>
<li>When developing you don't know when it will change (the app is so useful your company sells it to someone else).</li>
<li>I don't want to be stuck with changing the code every time a slight change is requested that could have been handled by setting up and using a good configuration model. </li>

186879,,"<p>First, you really should try not to have exceptions thrown - and not handled - in a background thread. If you control the way your delegate is run, encapsulate it in a try catch block and figure a way to pass the exception information back to your main thread (using EndInvoke if you explicitly called BeginInvoke, or by updating some shared state somewhere).</p>

<p>Ignoring a unhandled exception can be dangerous. If you have a real un-handlable exception (OutOfMemoryException comes into mind), there's not much you can do anyway and your process is basically doomed.</p>

<p>Back to .Net 1.1, an unhandled exception in a backgroundthread would just be thrown to nowhere and the main thread would gladly plough on. And that could have nasty repercussions. So in .Net 2.0 this behavior has changed.</p>

<p>Now, an unhandled exception thrown in a thread which is not the main thread will terminate the process. You may be notified of this (by subscribing to the event on the AppDomain) but the process will die nonetheless.</p>

<p>Since this can be inconvenient (when you don't know what will be run in the thread and you are not absolutely sure it's properly guarded, and your main thread must be resilient), there's a workaround. It's intended as a legacy settings (meaning, it's strongly suggested you make sure you don't have stray threads) but you can force the former behavior this way :</p>

<p>Just add this setting to your service/application/whatever configuration file :</p>

<p>D's template sublanguage, on the other hand, was actually designed for metaprogramming beyond simple type parameterization.  Andrei Alexandrescu <a href=""http://digitalmars.com/d/2.0/phobos/std_algorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">seems to love it,</a> but other people can actually understand his D templates.  It's also powerful enough that someone wrote a <a href=""http://h3.team0xf.com/ctrace/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">compile-time raytracer</a> in it as a proof of concept.</p>

<p>I guess the most useful/non-trivial metaprogram I ever wrote in D was a function template that, given a struct type as the template parameter and a list of column header names in an order corresponding to the variable declarations in the struct as a runtime parameter, will read in a CSV file, and return an array of structs, one for each row, with each struct field corresponding to a column.  All type conversions (string to float, int, etc.) are done automatically, based on the types of the template fields.</p>

<p>Another good one, which mostly works, but still doesn't handle a few cases properly, is a deep copy function template that handles structs, classes, and arrays properly.  It uses only compile time reflection/introspection, so that it can work with structs, which, unlike full-blown classes, have no runtime reflection/introspection capabilities in D because they're supposed to be lightweight.</p>",,,3,,10/11/2008 00:22,,7/21/2018 1:27:58,7/21/2018 1:27:58,,4928,dsimcha,,63494,2,7,,

<p>This window uses the form definition above to actually submit the data.. in the ASHX page the data simply comes through as a posted form - i.e. you can access via normal Request.form object.. I know there is a way to essentially post the form data to the ASHX page as XML, although for my purpose it wasn't required - quite simple form.</p>

203655,,"<p>Having friends in programming is more-or-less considered ""dirty"" and easy to abuse. It breaks the relationships between classes and undermines some fundamental attributes of an OO language.</p>

<p>That being said, it is a nice feature and I've used it plenty of times myself in C++; and would like to use it in C# too. But I bet because of C#'s ""pure"" OOness (compared to C++'s pseudo OOness) MS decided that because Java has no friend keyword C# shouldn't either (just kidding ;))</p>

<p>On a serious note: internal is not as good as friend but it does get the job done. Remember that it is rare that you will be distributing your code to 3rd party developers not through a DLL; so as long as you and your team know about the internal classes and their use you should be fine.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Let me clarify how the friend keyword undermines OOP.</p>

<p>Private and protected variables and methods are perhaps one of the most important part of OOP. The idea that objects can hold data or logic that only they can use allows you to write your implementation of functionality independent of your environment - and that your environment cannot alter state information that it is not suited to handle. By using friend you are coupling two classes' implementations together - which is much worse then if you just coupled their interface. </p>",,,18,,10/15/2008 3:40:47,,7/24/2018 10:52:50,7/24/2018 10:52:50,Nelson LaQuet,3800096,user19302,,203616,2,70,,

<h2>Changes Made Between CodePlex Preview 5 and Beta</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed the default validation messages to be more end-user friendly.  </li>
<li>Renamed CompositeViewEngine to AutoViewEngine.</li>
<li>Added a Url property to Controller of type UrlHelper. This makes it convenient to generate routing-based URLs from within a controller.</li>
<li>Added the ActionNameSelectorAttribute abstract base class, which serves as the base type for ActionNameAttribute. By inheriting from this base attribute class, you can create custom attributes that participate in action selection by name.</li>
<li>Added a new ReleaseView method to IViewEngine that allows custom view engines to be notified when a view is done rendering. This is useful for cleanup or for view-pooling scenarios.</li>
<li>Renamed the ControllerBuilder method DisposeController to ReleaseController to fit with the pattern that is established for view engines.</li>
<li>Removed most of the methods on the HtmlHelper class, converting them to extension methods of the HtmlHelper class instead. These methods exist in a new namespace (System.Web.Mvc.Html). If you are migrating from Preview 5, you must add the following element to the namespaces section of the Web.config file:
<code>&lt;add namespace=""System.Web.Mvc.Html""/&gt;</code>
This makes it possible for you to completely replace our helper methods with your own. </li>
<li>Changed the default model binder (DefaultModelBinder) to handle complex types. The IModelBinder interface has also been changed to accept a single parameter of type ModelBindingContext.</li>
<li><p>Added a new HttpVerbs enumeration that contains the most commonly used HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD). Also added a constructor overload to AcceptVerbsAttribute that accepts the enumeration. The enumerated values can be combined. Because it is possible to respond to HTTP verbs that are not included in the enumeration, the AcceptVerbsAttribute retains the constructor that accepts an array of strings as a parameter.  For example, the following snippet shows an action method that can respond to both POST and PUT requests.  </p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post | HttpVerbs.Put)]  
public ActionResult Update() {...
}
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Modified the RadioButton helper method to ensure that every overload accepts a value. Because radio buttons are used to specify a choice from a set of possible values, specifying a value for a radio button is necessary.</p></li>
<li>Made modifications and fixes to the default project template. This includes moving script files to a new Scripts folder. The default template uses the ModelState class to report validation errors.</li>
<li><p>Changed action-method selection. If two action methods match a request, but only one of those has an attribute that derives from ActionMethodSelectorAttribute that matches the request, that action is invoked. In earlier releases, this scenario resulted in an exception. 
For example, the following two action methods are in the same controller:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Edit() {  
  //...  
}  

[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]  
public ActionResult Edit(FormCollection form) {  
  //...
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>In Preview 5, a POST request for the Edit action would cause an exception, because two methods match the request. In the Beta, precedence is given to the method that matches the current request via the AcceptVerb attribute. In this example, the first method will handle any non-POST requests for the Edit action.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Added an overload for the ViewDataDictionary.Eval method that accepts a format string.</li>
<li>Removed the ViewName property from the ViewContext class.</li>
<li>Added an IValueProvider interface for value providers, along with a default implementation, DefaultValueProvider. Value providers supply values that are used by the model binders when binding to a model object. The UpdateModel method of the Controller class has been updated to allow you to specify a custom value provider.</li>

230132,,"<p>Rabbit has the right answer for using references to edit values and index to unset in a foreach loop (I would vote you up but this is my first post so I don't have 15 rep yet, sorry)</p>

<p>be sure to remember to use the reference if you pass it through to a function that needs to edit the value as well.
You would also need to pass the array as a reference if it's to remove the value from it.</p>

<p>I'd recommend making the function return boolean on whether to remove to prevent creating more references. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array AS $key =&gt; &amp;$value) {
    //&amp; reference only needed if execFunction must edit $value
    if (execFunction(&amp;$value)) { 
        unset($array[$key]);
    } else {
        $value['exec_failed']+=1;
    }
}
unset($value);
</code></pre>

<p>also the $value reference will persist past the scope of the loop, thus the trailing unset.</p>

234737,,"<p>It works very well <strong>if you understand it</strong>.</p>

<p>There are also 2 flavors of polymorphism. The first is very easy to understand in java-esque:</p>

<pre><code>interface A{

   int foo();

}

final class B implements A{

   int foo(){ print(""B""); }

}

final class C implements A{

   int foo(){ print(""C""); }

}
</code></pre>

<p>B and C share a common interface. B and C in this case can't be extended, so you're always sure which foo() you're calling. Same goes for C++, just make A::foo pure virtual.</p>

<p>Second, and trickier is run-time polymorphism. It doesn't look too bad in pseudo-code.</p>

<pre><code>class A{

   int foo(){print(""A"");}

}

class B extends A{

   int foo(){print(""B"");}

}

class C extends B{

  int foo(){print(""C"");}

}

...

class Z extends Y{

   int foo(){print(""Z"");

}

main(){

   F* f = new Z();
   A* a = f;
   a-&gt;foo();
   f-&gt;foo();

}
</code></pre>

<p>But it is a lot trickier. Especially if you're working in C++ where some of the foo declarations may be virtual, and some of the inheritance might be virtual. Also the answer to this:</p>

<pre><code>A* a  = new Z;
A  a2 = *a;
a-&gt;foo();
a2.foo();
</code></pre>

<p>might not be what you expect.</p>

        and overwrite the cookies with the passed in values.

        The theory is that at this point (BeginRequest) the cookies have not been ready by
        the Session and Authentication logic and if we update the cookies here we'll get our
        Session and Authentication restored correctly
