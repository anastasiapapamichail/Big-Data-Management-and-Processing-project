    "body": "<p>GPS, the Global Positioning System run by the United States Military, is free for civilian use, though the reality is that we're paying for it with tax dollars.</p>\n\n<p>However, GPS on cell phones is a bit more murky.  In general, it won't cost you anything to turn on the GPS in your cell phone, but when you get a location it usually involves the cell phone company in order to get it quickly with little signal, as well as get a location when the satellites aren't visible (since the gov't requires a fix even if the satellites aren't visible for emergency 911 purposes).  It uses up some cellular bandwidth.  This also means that for phones without a regular GPS receiver, you cannot use the GPS at all if you don't have cell phone service.</p>\n\n<p>For this reason most cell phone companies have the GPS in the phone turned off except for emergency calls and for services they sell you (such as directions).</p>\n\n<p>This particular kind of GPS is called assisted GPS (AGPS), and there are several levels of assistance used.</p>\n\n<h2>GPS</h2>\n\n<p>A normal GPS receiver listens to a particular frequency for radio signals.  Satellites send time coded messages at this frequency.  Each satellite has an atomic clock, and sends the current exact time as well.</p>\n\n<p>The GPS receiver figures out which satellites it can hear, and then starts gathering those messages.  The messages include time, current satellite positions, and a few other bits of information.  The message stream is slow - this is to save power, and also because all the satellites transmit on the same frequency and they're easier to pick out if they go slow.  Because of this, and the amount of information needed to operate well, it can take 30-60 seconds to get a location on a regular GPS.</p>\n\n<p>When it knows the position and time code of at least 3 satellites, a GPS receiver can assume it's on the earth's surface and get a good reading.  4 satellites are needed if you aren't on the ground and you want altitude as well.</p>\n\n<h2>AGPS</h2>\n\n<p>As you saw above, it can take a long time to get a position fix with a normal GPS.  There are ways to speed this up, but unless you're carrying an atomic clock with you all the time, or leave the GPS on all the time, then there's always going to be a delay of between 5-60 seconds before you get a location.</p>\n\n<p>In order to save cost, most cell phones share the GPS receiver components with the cellular components, and you can't get a fix and talk at the same time.  People don't like that (especially when there's an emergency) so the lowest form of GPS does the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Get some information from the cell phone company to feed to the GPS receiver - some of this is gross positioning information based on what cellular towers can 'hear' your phone, so by this time they already phone your location to within a city block or so.</li>\n<li>Switch from cellular to GPS receiver for 0.1 second (or some small, practically unoticable period of time) and collect the raw GPS data (no processing on the phone).</li>\n<li>Switch back to the phone mode, and send the raw data to the phone company</li>\n<li>The phone company processes that data (acts as an offline GPS receiver) and send the location back to your phone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This saves a lot of money on the phone design, but it has a heavy load on cellular bandwidth, and with a lot of requests coming it requires a lot of fast servers.  Still, overall it can be cheaper and faster to implement.  They are reluctant, however, to release GPS based features on these phones due to this load - so you won't see turn by turn navigation here.</p>\n\n<p>More recent designs include a full GPS chip.  They still get data from the phone company - such as current location based on tower positioning, and current satellite locations - this provides sub 1 second fix times.  This information is only needed once, and the GPS can keep track of everything after that with very little power.  If the cellular network is unavailable, then they can still get a fix after awhile.  If the GPS satellites aren't visible to the receiver, then they can still get a rough fix from the cellular towers.</p>\n\n<p>But to completely answer your question - it's as free as the phone company lets it be, and so far they do not charge for it at all.  I doubt that's going to change in the future.  In the higher end phones with a full GPS receiver you may even be able to load your own software and access it, such as with mologogo on a motorola iDen phone - the J2ME development kit is free, and the phone is only $40 (prepaid phone with $5 credit).  Unlimited internet is about $10 a month, so for $40 to start and $10 a month you can get an internet tracking system. (Prices circa August 2008)</p>\n\n<p>It's only going to get cheaper and more full featured from here on out...</p>\n\n<p>Re: Google maps and such</p>\n\n<p>Yes, Google maps and all other cell phone mapping systems require a data connection of some sort at varying times during usage.  When you move far enough in one direction, for instance, it'll request new tiles from its server.  Your average phone doesn't have enough storage to hold a map of the US, nor the processor power to render it nicely. iPhone would be able to if you wanted to use the storage space up with maps, but given that most iPhones have a full time unlimited data plan most users would rather use that space for other things.</p>",

    "body": "<p>Contrary to what some others have posted, there's nothing wrong catching all exceptions. The important thing is to handle them all appropriately. If you have a stack overflow or out of memory condition, the app should shut down for them. Also, keep in mind that OOM conditions can prevent your exception handler from running correctly. For example, if your exception handler displays a dialog with the exception message, if you're out of memory, there may not be enough left for the dialog display.

If you have a stack overflow or out of memory condition, the app should shut down for them. Also, keep in mind that OOM conditions can prevent your exception handler from running correctly. For example, if your exception handler displays a dialog with the exception message, if you're out of memory, there may not be enough left for the dialog display.

To earn points each user must add links that get positive votes.</li>\n<li>Then, users can vote -3,-2,-1,1,2 or 3 votes for each link. As the votes are limited, each user will vote only on those links that they like.</li>\n<li>To prevent user to vote only on links for the same user, creating support groups, the points each vote adds to the link depends on a racio between total votes and votes to links of the owner of the voted link. If you always vote on the same users links, your votes will lose value.</li>\n<li>Votes lose value with time.</li>\n<li>New links from users who don't have points (new users) will have a starting 0 points. New links from older users will have points depending on their points. Ranging from +3 to -infinite. Links from users with negative points will have negative starting points, links from users with positive points will have positive starting points.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Users will get random points when their links are voted.

The potential problem with the approach is that as the number of types increases, the number of comparisons that must be executed increases as well.</p>\n\n<p>if I execute the following:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>int value = 25124;\nif(value == 0) ...\nelse if (value == 1) ...\nelse if (value == 2) ...\n...\nelse if (value == 25124) ... \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>each of the previous if conditions must be evaluated before the correct block is entered.

At a low level, strings can't be switched on in the same way that integer values can so the C# compiler does some magic to make this work for you.  </p>\n\n<p>If the switch statement is \"small enough\" (where the compiler does what it thinks is best automatically) switching on strings generates code that is the same as an if/else chain.</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>switch(someString) {\n    case \"Foo\": DoFoo(); break;\n    case \"Bar\": DoBar(); break;\n    default: DoOther; break;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is the same as:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>if(someString == \"Foo\") {\n    DoFoo();\n} else if(someString == \"Bar\") {\n    DoBar();\n} else {\n    DoOther();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once the list of items in the dictionary gets \"big enough\" the compiler will automatically create an internal dictionary that maps from the strings in the switch to an integer index and then a switch based on that index.</p>\n\n<p>It looks something like this (Just imagine more entries than I am going to bother to type)</p>\n\n<p>A static field is defined in a \"hidden\" location that is associated with the class containing the switch statement of type <code>Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;</code> and given a mangled name </p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>//Make sure the dictionary is loaded\nif(theDictionary == null) { \n    //This is simplified for clarity, the actual implementation is more complex \n    // in order to ensure thread safety\n    theDictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string,int&gt;();\n    theDictionary[\"Foo\"] = 0;\n    theDictionary[\"Bar\"] = 1;\n}\n\nint switchIndex;\nif(theDictionary.TryGetValue(someString, out switchIndex)) {\n    switch(switchIndex) {\n    case 0: DoFoo(); break;\n    case 1: DoBar(); break;\n    }\n} else {\n    DoOther();\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In some quick tests that I just ran, the If/Else method is about 3x as fast as the switch for 3 different types (where the types are randomly distributed).  At 25 types the switch is faster by a small margin (16%) at 50 types the switch is more than twice as fast.</p>\n\n<p>If you are going to be switching on a large number of types, I would suggest a 3rd method:</p>\n\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>private delegate void NodeHandler(ChildNode node);\n\nstatic Dictionary&lt;RuntimeTypeHandle, NodeHandler&gt; TypeHandleSwitcher = CreateSwitcher();\n\nprivate static Dictionary&lt;RuntimeTypeHandle, NodeHandler&gt; CreateSwitcher()\n{\n    var ret = new Dictionary&lt;RuntimeTypeHandle, NodeHandler&gt;();\n\n    ret[typeof(Bob).TypeHandle] = HandleBob;\n    ret[typeof(Jill).TypeHandle] = HandleJill;\n    ret[typeof(Marko).TypeHandle] = HandleMarko;\n\n    return ret;\n}\n\nvoid HandleChildNode(ChildNode node)\n{\n    NodeHandler handler;\n    if (TaskHandleSwitcher.TryGetValue(Type.GetRuntimeType(node), out handler))\n    {\n        handler(node);\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        //Unexpected type...\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is similar to what Ted Elliot suggested, but the usage of runtime type handles instead of full type objects avoids the overhead of loading the type object through reflection.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some quick timings on my machine:</p>\n\n<pre>\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=Random) and 5 types\nMethod                Time    % of optimal\nIf/Else               179.67  100.00\nTypeHandleDictionary  321.33  178.85\nTypeDictionary        377.67  210.20\nSwitch                492.67  274.21\n\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=Random) and 10 types\nMethod                Time    % of optimal\nIf/Else               271.33  100.00\nTypeHandleDictionary  312.00  114.99\nTypeDictionary        374.33  137.96\nSwitch                490.33  180.71\n\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=Random) and 15 types\nMethod                Time    % of optimal\nTypeHandleDictionary  312.00  100.00\nIf/Else               369.00  118.27\nTypeDictionary        371.67  119.12\nSwitch                491.67  157.59\n\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=Random) and 20 types\nMethod                Time    % of optimal\nTypeHandleDictionary  335.33  100.00\nTypeDictionary        373.00  111.23\nIf/Else               462.67  137.97\nSwitch                490.33  146.22\n\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=Random) and 25 types\nMethod                Time    % of optimal\nTypeHandleDictionary  319.33  100.00\nTypeDictionary        371.00  116.18\nSwitch                483.00  151.25\nIf/Else               562.00  175.99\n\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=Random) and 50 types\nMethod                Time      % of optimal\nTypeHandleDictionary  319.67    100.00\nTypeDictionary        376.67    117.83\nSwitch                453.33    141.81\nIf/Else               1,032.67  323.04\n\n</pre>\n\n<p>On my machine at least, the type handle dictionary approach beats all of the others for anything over 15 different types when the distribution\nof the types used as input to the method is random.  </p>\n\n<p>If on the other hand, the input is composed entirely of the type that is checked first in the if/else chain that method is <em>much</em> faster:</p>\n\n<pre>\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=UniformFirst) and 50 types\nMethod                Time    % of optimal\nIf/Else               39.00   100.00\nTypeHandleDictionary  317.33  813.68\nTypeDictionary        396.00  1,015.38\nSwitch                403.00  1,033.33\n</pre>\n\n<p>Conversely, if the input is always the last thing in the if/else chain, it has the opposite effect:</p>\n\n<pre>\nTesting 3 iterations with 5,000,000 data elements (mode=UniformLast) and 50 types\nMethod                Time      % of optimal\nTypeHandleDictionary  317.67    100.00\nSwitch                354.33    111.54\nTypeDictionary        377.67    118.89\nIf/Else               1,907.67  600.52\n</pre>\n\n<p>If you can make some assumptions about your input, you might get the best performance from a hybrid approach where you perform if/else checks for the few types that are most common, and then fall back to a dictionary-driven approach if those fail.</p>",

In fact, they are generally used for almost all types of text data (such as names/addresses/et cetera) - but in these instances you must be careful that the number you supply is a sane maximum for the type of data that will fill that column.</p>\n\n<p>However, you must also be careful when using them to only allow the user to input the maximum amount of characters that the field will support. Otherwise it may lend to confusion when it truncates the user's input.</p>",

Here's the list of changes from the readme:</p>\n\n<h2>Changes Made Between CodePlex Preview 5 and Beta</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Changed the default validation messages to be more end-user friendly.  </li>\n<li>Renamed CompositeViewEngine to AutoViewEngine.</li>\n<li>Added a Url property to Controller of type UrlHelper. This makes it convenient to generate routing-based URLs from within a controller.</li>\n<li>Added the ActionNameSelectorAttribute abstract base class, which serves as the base type for ActionNameAttribute. By inheriting from this base attribute class, you can create custom attributes that participate in action selection by name.</li>\n<li>Added a new ReleaseView method to IViewEngine that allows custom view engines to be notified when a view is done rendering. This is useful for cleanup or for view-pooling scenarios.</li>\n<li>Renamed the ControllerBuilder method DisposeController to ReleaseController to fit with the pattern that is established for view engines.</li>\n<li>Removed most of the methods on the HtmlHelper class, converting them to extension methods of the HtmlHelper class instead. These methods exist in a new namespace (System.Web.Mvc.Html). If you are migrating from Preview 5, you must add the following element to the namespaces section of the Web.config file:\n<code>&lt;add namespace=\"System.Web.Mvc.Html\"/&gt;</code>\nThis makes it possible for you to completely replace our helper methods with your own. </li>\n<li>Changed the default model binder (DefaultModelBinder) to handle complex types. The IModelBinder interface has also been changed to accept a single parameter of type ModelBindingContext.</li>\n<li><p>Added a new HttpVerbs enumeration that contains the most commonly used HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, HEAD). Also added a constructor overload to AcceptVerbsAttribute that accepts the enumeration. The enumerated values can be combined. Because it is possible to respond to HTTP verbs that are not included in the enumeration, the AcceptVerbsAttribute retains the constructor that accepts an array of strings as a parameter.  For example, the following snippet shows an action method that can respond to both POST and PUT requests.  </p>\n\n<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post | HttpVerbs.Put)]  \npublic ActionResult Update() {...\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>Modified the RadioButton helper method to ensure that every overload accepts a value. Because radio buttons are used to specify a choice from a set of possible values, specifying a value for a radio button is necessary.</p></li>\n<li>Made modifications and fixes to the default project template. This includes moving script files to a new Scripts folder. The default template uses the ModelState class to report validation errors.</li>\n<li><p>Changed action-method selection. If two action methods match a request, but only one of those has an attribute that derives from ActionMethodSelectorAttribute that matches the request, that action is invoked. In earlier releases, this scenario resulted in an exception. \nFor example, the following two action methods are in the same controller:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public ActionResult Edit() {  \n  //...  \n}  \n\n[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]  \npublic ActionResult Edit(FormCollection form) {  \n  //...\n}\n</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In Preview 5, a POST request for the Edit action would cause an exception, because two methods match the request. In the Beta, precedence is given to the method that matches the current request via the AcceptVerb attribute. In this example, the first method will handle any non-POST requests for the Edit action.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Added an overload for the ViewDataDictionary.Eval method that accepts a format string.</li>\n<li>Removed the ViewName property from the ViewContext class.</li>\n<li>Added an IValueProvider interface for value providers, along with a default implementation, DefaultValueProvider. Value providers supply values that are used by the model binders when binding to a model object. The UpdateModel method of the Controller class has been updated to allow you to specify a custom value provider.</li>\n</ul>",

Mods are often teachers, they are often trusted, and they are always engaged. They definitely know that the community is larger than the stated goal of the community, and they participate within the community regularly.</p>\n\n<p>I'm active on MSO having over 900 points (granted, I'm nowhere near the top, but I'm in the top 500 sure enough), I'm active on SO (I think 3500 points qualifies me as understanding the system and actively participating), I'm a regular SE enthusiast, and I'm currently helping DBA.StackExchange.com get off the ground, where I'm also a regular on both the site and the meta. Many people have observed that I'm just about as committed to the SE system as anyone can be.</p>\n\n<p>I am often found in the SO chatrooms, the MSO chatrooms, and on some of the SE chatrooms. I routinely help people work out their problems by way of rubberducking and encourage them to post a proper SO question that we can then use for collaboration and that can in turn give back to the community.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Enough about that, let's focus on what you care about:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Why does someone want to volunteer to be a mod?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Surely the person who <em>volunteers</em> for a public-good task is probably the least suited for the job, yeah? </p>\n\n<p>That would be true if I were asking to be a SOIS - Community Senator or something, but I'm really just looking to be a better janitor. I already flag questions for close, suggest comments on how to make other questions better, edit titles/tags/questions, and generally help with the upkeep. But I would be happy to take that one step further and help a little more, because I believe in SOIS and the mission to make the internet a better place.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, I also realize that I could just be some power hungry guy looking to make a name for himself as a ruthless mod, exacting bloody vengeance throughout the community as tho I were the grim reaper and my mod abilities were my scythe. But with Jeff on the horizon, I doubt anyone could pull that stunt at this point, even if they were so inclined. So no, I don't want to be a <em>god mod</em>, I just want to help keep the SO community in good general repair, and help out as I can.</p>",

    "body": "<p>I've been thinking about this for some time now, and I'd also like to nominate myself for the Stack Overflow 2011 community moderator election.</p>\n\n<p>If nothing else, I have a tremendous amount of respect for this community and what it has accomplished, as well as a passion for contributing.  I may not be one of the original users, or one of the reputation stars, or stand out from the crowd in any particular way... But I'm here and I'm contributing and I want to do what I can to help where I can.</p>\n\n<p>Stack Overflow has provided me with help on countless occasions.  I haven't asked many questions because at least 3/4 of the time the question I have has already been asked and answered.  There is a wealth of content here and it's growing every day.  Given everything I've received from this website, I want to help keep it going.  I want to help maintain the standards that make this community so great.</p>\n\n<p>I'll let <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/328193/david?tab=accounts\">the content I've provided</a> to this community speak for itself.  I like to think some of it is great.  I admit much of it is mediocre.  I also admit some of it is poor.  (Indeed, I'm sure I've left some comments from time to time which really aren't constructive at all.  We all make mistakes, and I'm no exception to that.)  All of it together represents who I am and how I contribute to this community.</p>\n\n<p>My reputation graph seems to reflect the time I spend on this site in the fact that there are months where I'm here constantly and there are months where I barely contribute.  My professional life sometimes keeps me away from this community, but I'm never so far as to not help out in some way.  Even on days when I can't find the questions to answer or the time to answer them, I'm still here browsing the content.  Learning from others, helping to moderate (voting to close or migrate, leaving hopefully helpful comments on questions for which I don't otherwise have an answer, and so on), sometimes just bumming around and looking for a way to contribute.</p>\n\n<p>Between the wonderful content which has helped me on countless occasions, the content I've provided which has helped me grow as a developer, the members of the community with whom I've interacted, and even the wonderful job I landed through Stack Overflow Careers... I've gained so much from this community.  Being a moderator is another way for me to give back.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your consideration, and thank you for taking the time to participate in the Stack Overflow community moderator election.</p>",

I've spent enough time on other sites to know why SO is so special and how it truly excels. Stackoverflow has been one of the greatest things that has happened to the programming world in the past two years, and its been of a massive help to so many people.</p>\n\n<p>However, I know there is always room for improvement, and with a community this powerful and dedicated, anything is possible. I came here a total beginner, and although I still have a long way to go, I've seen so many unique aspects of SO on my journey through programming. There's truly no other site where people can have fun, learn, and teach and have fun while talking about the subject they truly love like stackoverflow. This site is something special that happens once in a lifetime, and I want to do everything I can to make it the best place it can be.</p>\n\n<p>I spend a lot of time on meta, the blog, and area51, and I want to be there for every step stackoverflow takes so I can be of as much of a help as possible, either as a moderator, teacher, or just a plain participator in the community. All of them are great honors that I am happy to have. I know what the site looks like from a total beginner's point of view because I sort of grew up here. I know how people feel to get downvoted for bad posts, how it feels to get questions closed, and how it feels when somebody greets you with a smile and takes time to try to help you understand. </p>\n\n<p>Moderation is not about the posts, its about the people who will make and read the posts. Its a moderator's responsibility to educate other users about the site and help them understand how things work. The buttons granted to you represent the people's trust in you to control their experience. Making that experience as good as possible is <em>always</em> your goal. Hence, moderation should be done as lightly as possible, and the community should be able to weigh in as much as possible on moderator decisions. Comments that explain what you are thinking about doing and why are vital for both the poster and the viewer, because they ultimately educate the community and make sure that you are doing what they want and helping them as much as possible, and only with the community's feedback can I know if I'm doing my job correctly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Short Version:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I would love to have the honor to help make SO better, even though everyone with an account really has that privilege. </li>\n<li>I've grown up here, so I've seen things from many different angles.</li>\n<li>Moderation privileges should be an <em>extension</em> of other user's power in the community. The community makes the decisions as to what should truly happen, the moderators are just the workers that try to keep up and meet their desires as much as possible and push the buttons to make things happen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the community chooses me, although I know my chances are slim with all the other bright and dedicated people here, I promise I will do all to make this place even more awesome.  :D</p>\n\n<p><strong>Accounts: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/89989/crazyjugglerdrummer\">stackoverflow</a>, <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/130281/crazyjugglerdrummer\">meta</a>, <a href=\"http://area51.stackexchange.com/users/1268/crazyjugglerdrummer\">area51</a></strong></p>",

I posted my <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/1881237/227665\">first question</a> asking how to use regex to parse and extract from HTML :) One of the comments had a link to the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454#1732454\">all time famous answer of why not to parse HTML using\nregex</a>.

How long would be dependent on the user's activity, it would have to be a period long enough to have an impact.</p>\n\n<p>Suspending a user for a day when they come to the site once every two weeks will have little effect.</p>\n\n<p>If I cannot find any information that the user has been informed of the proper procedure then I will do so in the comments, suggesting that the user add it as a comment.  I'd then monitor the user's behavior for a little bit, and inform my fellow moderators about that user's activities.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288703#288703\">What's your top reason why you want to be a moderator?</a> - <a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/16587/george-stocker\">George\n  Stocker</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like to help.

Low-quality posts would be deleted.

If the content is offensive or hateful in any way, it should be deleted.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are a good number of times where the question might have a better life on another SE site, or if it is of questionably low quality, a nudge (in the form of a comment) can encourage a user to turn low-quality content into good content.</p>\n\n<p>Deleting should be aggressive when the content is of an obviously detrimental nature to SO and the community; other means should be used when it is not.</p>\n\n<p>There are more questions, but I really like and want to answer this one:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/505?m=288881#288881\">PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY QUESTION: Ability to edit other people's answers\n  - great SO feature, or greatest SO feature?</a> - <a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/users/811/shog9\">Shog9</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It <em>is</em> a great feature, but it is not SO's <em>greatest</em> feature, IMO.  The vote is SO's greatest feature; so much of what is done on SO is predicated on the vote, it opens/closes gateways to so many other features which serve to encourage the community to help keep the system running in a healthy manner.</p>\n\n<p>I love that we can edit posts and take great pride in doing it (as I've done it quite often), but to me, the vote and all that it enables is the single greatest feature of SO (IMO).</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>General Philosophy</h2>\n\n<p>This election, I didn't just \"throw my hat into the ring\", that was what I did the last time I nominated myself, not approaching it with the seriousness it deserves.  </p>\n\n<p>Since then, there's been time to reflect on the position, and as to whether or not I truly want it.  My answer is a resounding \"yes\".  This time, I approach the election and the position with a seriousness, passion, and commitment that the position demands.</p>\n\n<p>Reputation is important.  It's the quantifiable cornerstone of what Stack Overflow is built on.</p>\n\n<p>The pursuit of reputation, however is not important.  What is of more importance are the actions one takes to foster the community in a positive direction (one of the reasons for the badge requirements, I gather, which I fully support).</p>\n\n<p>That said, I've long been an advocate of improving the quality of the experience for <em>everyone</em> at SO; editing posts for spelling and grammar mistakes, formatting code for readability, voting to close/migrate posts, flagging posts (<em>never</em> out of spite or malice, but always with the goal of improving the overall quality of the question and/or system).</p>\n\n<p>These are things that there are no (or difficult to acquire) metrics for.  They are tedious and thankless, and yet still must be done in order to keep the quality bar high.</p>\n\n<p>These are the tasks that I take joy in providing, knowing that the actions I take based on the care I have for a better experience have a real, lasting effect.</p>\n\n<p>I am a passionate believer in the neutrality that a <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/faq#editing\">collaborative, wiki-like site such as Stack Overflow</a> strives to maintain.  I believe in this so much so that I've <strong>never</strong> had a problem <strong>voting/flagging my own content for removal</strong> in order to improve the overall quality.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>Why I believe I should be one of your next moderators</h2>\n\n<p>I've never asked nor expected thanks.  This is why being a moderator is perfect for me.  I revel in the tasks that I know must be done (just look at my <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/50776/casperone?tab=reputation#page_1-view_graph\">reputation gain over the last year vs. the past two years</a>); the work is it's own reward.  </p>\n\n<p>Being a moderator is allows me to do more of this work and on a greater scale.  It enables me to do what I love and provide for a better user experience for all.</p>\n\n<p>I'm passionate about helping.  As a creator of a <a href=\"http://sf4answers.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stack Overflow clone</a>, I've been able to combine my passion for technology and for helping others.</p>\n\n<p>I'll bring that same passion to the moderator role when elected.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>Q&A</h2>\n\n<p>Come to <a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule\">next the town hall meeting (or two!) for moderator election nominees</a>, and ask ask ask!</p>\n\n<p>That's up to you!  Be aggressive and <strong>ask the questions in the comments that are important to you in the comments</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Ask the things <strong>you feel you must know about your candidate</strong> that will guide your decision in this election.</p>\n\n<p>I'll answer <strong>everything</strong> with the same transparency that I will bring to my actions as a moderator.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\n\n<p>A sincere thank you to all for reading and for any support you provide.</p>",

    "body": "<p>I'd like to nominate myself for StackOverflow moderator. I am very active in the community -- mostly within the C# and general .NET tags -- and frequently help moderate questions and answers (either by improving them if possible or voting to close/delete or flagging) using the 10k+ user tools, but I feel like I would be a helpful addition to the formal moderating team.</p>\n\n<h1>Why?</h1>\n\n<p>I've been a member of StackOverflow for more than two and a half years. In that time, I've committed myself to making SO a better site, and my interaction has (hopefully) been in line with that goal. </p>\n\n<h3>Qualifications</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have a good handle on grammar and punctuation (son of an English teacher; sue me), and I try to give a helping hand to questions where the meaning is clear with some effort, but language issues might prevent them from getting the high-quality answers they deserve.</li>\n<li>I am available during the peak StackOverflow hours (the workday in the western hemisphere) and frequently answer and moderate questions during this time.</li>\n<li>I have experience with other forms of internet moderation (e.g. forum moderator, panel discussion facilitator, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Moderation Policy</h2>\n\n<p>While personally no stranger to the close vote (or delete vote when it's warranted), I tend to be fairly inclusive when it comes to the questions that I come across. Questions that are blatantly too broad (asking for someone to write a complete application, for example) I'll generally close--especially if they come from someone who's been around the block and should know better--but I'll also try to help the user either define what their question actually <em>is</em> or give a couple of suggestions to get them started so that they can come back with a specific technical question.</p>\n\n<p>I think that moderation should take the long view; after all, the purpose of StackOverflow is to provide the internets with a resource for <em>finding solutions</em>, not necessarily asking questions. To that end, I generally tailor my moderation practices to favor questions that have a lasting, broad appeal, or those that strike a good balance between specificity and generality. With that said, I still personally try to help users (or at least point them in the right direction) even if their question isn't well suited to the site.</p>\n\n<h2>So...now what?</h2>\n\n<p>If you've taken the time to read my nomination, then thank you! I'm guessing, though, that I haven't answered all of your questions. If so (or even if not), please come to <a href=\"http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/info/505/town-hall-chat?tab=schedule\">one of the scheduled Town Hall meetings</a> and ask away; I'm currently scheduled to attend the first meeting (Tuesday, 11/15/2011 at 9:00pm Eastern), but I will make every effort to attend the second meeting as well, assuming that work obligations allow for it.</p>\n\n<p>As a great man once said: tuna, eggs, Doritos, cheesecake, tamale; see ya!</p>",

    "body": "<p>I believe I'd make a fair and useful moderator for the following reasons:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Time: I currently use Stack Overflow to fill what would otherwise be idle time. This typically replaces \"reading the news\" whilst eating breakfast/lunch, the 5-10 minutes whilst building/testing some new code. Stack Overflow filled a newsgroup sized hole in my habits when my local NNTP server got pulled because nobody else was using it any more! My usual time-zone is GMT/BST.</p></li>\n<li><p>Active: I'm fairly active in the C++ and C++11 tags, although by no means the most active in either. As well as that I regularly look over the \"late answers to old questions\" list, looking for answers that need editing or look suspicious in some way (e.g. spam/sockpuppets). I have some experience in a number of other tags too, as well as basic sysadmin experience which I've used to raise flags to prevent inappropriate migrations to Server Fault in particular.</p></li>\n<li><p>Badges: I have the requisite badges (and actually the gold equivalents of the silver ones too). I actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge I'm able to flag the problem posts that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful, but occasionally get disputed; which I avoided before getting the badges. I mostly like doing things because they're useful. Badges were a distraction from that, moderator access would increase the number of useful actions available.</p></li>\n<li><p>Awareness: I feel I know my limitations. I'm fairly good at knowing when and where I should seek further advice. As an example one of the first things I did after getting access to the 10K tools was ask about how best to handle several borderline cases on chat and read a lot of meta posts about the 10K tools. I've also raised quite a few flags that ran along the lines of \"there are several problems here, (list of problems) - I'm not sure how best to proceed\" and then observed the action taken by moderators.</p></li>\n<li><p>Fair and objective: In my view all of my actions to date on this site (and others on the network) have been objective and fair. I'm able to recognise the danger signs of losing that objectivity and step back to allow someone else to handle that and avoid escalating a situation into a conflict. In the past that's been through flagging (and a keen watch to see the result). As a moderator that would be walking away to let someone else handle it.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Summary: I feel like I've seen how things work around here, I have time to offer and I'd like access to the moderator tools to convert my time into direct actions rather than simply adding them to somebody else's list of tasks.</p>",

What this bit of information <strong>really</strong> means is that not only do I do a reasonable volume of work, that work is of a good quality. What doesn't show directly in that flag weight is the number of questions that I have tidied up or voted on as a result of reviewing those flags.

I have previously moderated on other forums, dealing with the h4x0rs and crackers in the open discussion area on masmforum.com certainly helps build a thick skin and no nonsense approach. I am located in the bottom end of the world (new Zealand, not far from Australia), in a timezone that is nicely offset from the UK and USA, which means I can catch questions and clean-up while others are sleeping.</p>\n\n<p>If you want to know how I roll, check out my answers in the <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/112443/november-2011-moderator-election-town-hall-chat-digest-1\">Town Hall Chat Digest #1</a>.

I also have a couple of things I would like to achieve:  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to really get the <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/108579/canonical-answers-for-repeated-questions\">canonical answer concept</a> going. There are some answers that really are so good that they should be recognised as THE answer, and subsequent duplicate questions should be pointed back to that original answer. Imagine if <strong>you</strong> get recognised as the author of one of these canonical answers! Once this gets traction I can see it improving the answer quality markedly as people strive to attain this.</li>\n<li>There are a lot of old <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/107712/old-best-book-resource-questions\"><em>\"What is the best ...\"</em></a> type questions - many of these have limited relevance one or two years on, but some of them still have some value. These need to be rationalised, the goods ones kept and the bad ones 'cancelled'. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are goals that will take some time (and co-operation from fellow moderators and SO'ers) to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the amount of time I already spend on the site over the day, being a moderator on Stack Overflow is not going to require any extra effort on my part, it will simply enable me to do a more comprehensive job than what I'm currently able to do. In addition to the current flow of work there is still a lot to be done cleaning up historical questions, and having moderator privileges will assist with that. \n<br/></p>\n\n<p><br/>\nThanks for listening :)  <br/><br/></p>",

The web is dynamic and always evolving. Because of that, Stack Overflow holds a special place in my heart as a place to teach and learn.</p>\n\n<p>While my initial goals on Stack Overflow were to grow as a developer, I have also evolved. The time I spend here now revolves around improving content. My philosophy is that <em>a question that is well organized and concise attracts more quality answers</em>. Furthermore, the benefits progress how our questions are indexed by search engines.</p>\n\n<p>One area which I believe needs a lot of love is tagging. I want to be more hands-on in SO's taxonomy, helping to bring content into the eyes of the subject matter experts. Content is only as good as it is accessible.</p>\n\n<p>Numbers can tell a story, but I don't put much weight in them. I'm here to help, not get the high score. If you're interested in how I've contributed over the past 5 years, please <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/542517/michael-irigoyen\">visit my profile</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to everyone! There are a lot of outstanding members in the community who continue to make SO the best professional Q&amp;A site!</p>",

My name is Rocket (not really).  I've been a member of StackOverflow for almost 1.25 years.  I used to work as a Computer Science tutor in college, so I like to help people.

    "body": "<p>I was excited when Stack Overflow was first announced. I wasn't a regular reader of Coding Horror or Joel on Software. In fact, I slightly distrusted both of them for using Microsoft products<sup>1</sup>. But they both seemed competent <em>enough</em> to save us from the evils of Experts-Exchange, and I joined for the private beta (with user id 1114).</p>\n\n<p>When the site launched I recommended it to everybody. I was happy with the site overall; I participated occasionally and made a few posts on UserVoice, but many of Joel and Jeff's decisions irritated me. They seemed arbitrary and bizarre, and reinforced my existing negative impressions of them.</p>\n\n<p>A few years later (~six months ago) I <em>finally</em> ended up listening to an episode of the podcast. I can't remember why, it was probably recommended by some meta thread. As I listened, I was surprised. They actually sounded quite reasonable! I listened to more of the archive, and more, and then started reading old meta threads.</p>\n\n<p>All of a sudden old decisions that had seemed random began to make sense. As I started to appreciate the philosophy of Stack Overflow I became more excited about the site and <a href=\"http://stackexchange.com/users/851?tab=reputation\">my participation increased dramatically</a>. I had been transformed from an occasional user into a <strong>Fanatic</strong>! ;-)</p>\n\n<p>Since then, I've been very active on Stack Overflow and Meta, picking up <strong>Electorate</strong> on both sites. Most of the answers I've contributed have been in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/python\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;python&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">python</a> and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/javascript\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">javascript</a>, for which I have silver badges, though I also browse many tags I'm inexperienced with to learn about them. I've spent a while reviewing and searching through old posts and have the <strong>Marshal</strong> badge for reaching 749 flag weight. It would be very satisfying to be able to act directly instead of just creating work for others.</p>\n\n<p>I do my best to consider the site's philosophy and the community's consensus while editing. I don't have any <em>unique</em> plans for how I'd behave as a moderator; there's a lot of work to be done and I think I have the time, enthusiasm and competence to help. As a moderator, when I'm not sure how the community feels about an issue I'll look for and read previous meta discussions before taking action.</p>\n\n<p>As a last point, I have <strong>Publicist</strong> on Stack Overflow and <strong>Announcer</strong> on several smaller Stack Exchange sites, accounting for tens of thousands of visits.

I'd like to nominate myself as a candidate in this upcoming moderator election.</p>\n\n<p>The key part of being a moderator here is having good judgement, and I think that's something I do have. I've got a flag weight of <s>almost</s> over 600 (which would be more if I flagged questions instead of closing them manually since I got that privilege) and only around 4 flags that have been deemed invalid (hopefully) showing that I know what belongs where here, when to close or to migrate, or what's rude, harassment, or spam. I've come across many things before that don't belong on Stack Overflow and should be deleted, and I could definitely help manage the abundance of poorly written or unconstructive items instead of having to delegate it to moderators.</p>\n\n<p>Please don't let my age deter anybody. I can assure you that I'm just as mature as anyone else. Sometimes more so =)</p>\n\n<p>So... vote minitech! I'll delete stuff and edit and close it and whatnot.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Self-promotion!!!</h2>\n\n<p>If you think reputation and time spent here and things like that aren't important, don't read this section. Otherwise, please continue. =)</p>\n\n<p>I've been on Stack Overflow for less than a year (a little over 7 months) but I've already hit the 10k mark for reputation. I'm a very active participator here, especially in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/vb.net\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'vb.net'\" rel=\"tag\">vb.net</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%23\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'c#'\" rel=\"tag\">c#</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/javascript\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'javascript'\" rel=\"tag\">javascript</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/jquery\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'jquery'\" rel=\"tag\">jquery</a> and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/php\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'php'\" rel=\"tag\">php</a>, and out of the some 210 days I've been registered I've visited 193 days, editing, reviewing, asking, and answering all the while. Now that I have a laptop (yay!) I believe I have what it takes to be a moderator, since I can actively review everything, all the time.</p>",

I'm hichris123, a student who is <em>not</em> a pink gravatar in real life.</p>\n\n<p>For the past year or so, I've been involved with moderation more than answering/asking questions.

I'm also fairly active on Meta. Being a moderator would allow me to handle other people's flags, rather than bothering the current moderators with flags of my own, and also make the Stack Overflow community a cleaner place.

It's also being judicial, and knowing when to use a bit of diplomacy to make someone's experience more pleasant.

On SO I've mainly been active in <a href=\"/questions/tagged/r\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;r&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">r</a>. I'm a postdoc/lecturer at MIT, got my PhD from MIT in operations research, and got my undergrad from Maryland in math and computer science.</p>\n\n<h3>Why I'm Running</h3>\n\n<p>I'm the sort of person who is drawn to cleaning up messes; for instance, when I worked for a newspaper I was copy desk chief. On SO I find janitorial work rewarding and spend most of my time moderating. As a diamond mod I could expand the reach and impact of my moderation by addressing the range of issues raised through the flag queue.</p>\n\n<h3>Why Pick Me</h3>\n\n<p>I think I have a few characteristics of a good diamond mod:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Volume</strong>: I'm on the site a lot (much more than 30 minutes/day) and moderate at high volume (e.g. 8.6k helpful flags, 7.5k on Q+A). I think I could help knock down the size of the flag queue.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Touch</strong>: I take care when moderating to avoid deleting useful content (e.g. 267 helpful flags per declined/disputed). I would apply the same light touch as a diamond moderator, only stepping in when necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Moderating with Respect</strong>: I try to be respectful and understanding in moderation, especially with our newest users.</li>\n</ul>",

I believe to be friendly, outspoken and fair when dealing with people.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I have no clue if I'd make a good moderator. And I admit not being as enthusiastic about being one like some of the other nominees. I don't consider being a moderator a big thing. I am definitely not applying for fame or power here. But then again, maybe that's what would make me a good one, because I like to do the maintenance work.</p>\n\n<p>I've read through a Theory of Moderation and understand that being a moderator is not about exerting power but about interfering as little as possible, preferably in the background. I think I can handle that.</p>\n\n<p>Checking on flags and especially merging questions sounds like a welcome addition to my usual activities on StackOverflow. I'm already spending quite some time flagging and tagging and being a moderator could help me improve on these. The \"housekeeping\" is what I would mainly be looking forward to. Though I am not shy when it comes to handling disputes between members either.</p>\n\n<p>I am trigger happy when it comes to duplicates though and I run out of closevotes often. Having the privilege to insta-close duplicates is tempting. But I hope to resist the temptation and not abuse that power. Or as they say, with added power comes added responsibility, which I am willing to take.</p>\n\n<p>Well, I guess that's it. </p>",

I have been on the site since private beta an have participated in meta since its inception.

I believe that people who contribute to the site should be given time to bring contributions up to our community standard.  However, if any content on the site is considered below our standard, and the contributor has not made an effort to clean it up, it should be removed from the site to prevent clutter;</p>\n\n<p>I am very aware of and spend time viewing lots of the other Stack Exchange sites, so I am very familiar with what belongs here and what doesn't.</p>\n\n<p>I also understand that clutter will be the eventual downfall of the site, and keeping Stack Overflow's signal to noise ratio will be my first concern.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Credentials:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Long history with the site</li>\n<li>All of the required badges (including lots of ones that aren't required)</li>\n<li>Long-standing history of participation</li>\n<li>Fun and hard-working attitude</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I love Stack Overflow.

I also like to have fun and joke around.  I just wanted to keep this post as short as possible so I left out all of my awesome jokes...</p>\n\n<p>For a little more info, see a blog post I wrote about being a moderator for the last election.  <a href=\"http://codingbycoincidence.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-moderator-is.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://codingbycoincidence.blogspot.com/2011/01/what-moderator-is.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Oh, and I developed a <a href=\"http://stackapps.com/questions/818/stackwrap4j-java-wrapper\">Java library</a> using the StackExchange api.  I also build an <a href=\"http://stackapps.com/questions/1471/rep-compare-utility-for-comparing-reputation-version-0-8\">app for comparing reputation across sites</a> with that API.</p>\n\n<p>...Oh yeah, I've also been fairly active in reviewing edits.

I am founder of a software development company (specifically one that makes online games) that is now going into its third year. I spend a minimum of one to two hours on StackOverflow every day I possibly can (my \"consecutive days\" chain was broken by Flight Control going on strike and leaving me stranded Internet-less in the airport) and I try to answer as many questions as possible to help people as best I can.</p>\n\n<p>As part of my job, I administrate the forums for our online games, giving me plenty of experience in moderation and superhuman amounts of patience! But I also know when to intervene and cut things short if needed, while not being too strict either. I like to think I'm a good moderator, and I'd like to use that to help StackOverflow.</p>",

    "body": "<p>As self-aggrandizing as it is, I'm throwing my hat into the pool of nominations. =)</p>\n\n<p>When I initially became a member of SO, I was self-centered, there was a healthy concern about increasing reputation and comparing myself to others.  While I wouldn't judge anyone and say this is <em>bad</em> behavior, it runs contrary to what a moderator does.</p>\n\n<p>However, over time, I came to value the importance of maintaining the health of the ecosystem rather than my own reputation; this is evidenced by the flattening of my reputation curve and the increase in the number of edits for clarity (while maintaing the author's original meaning and style), retagging, voting (up, down, to close) and flagging for attention (even flagging my own question for because it was <em>too</em> specific).</p>\n\n<p>Yes, content is king on SO, but without the participation of the community in these areas, it becomes like any other web board, and as we know, it isn't just another web board.</p>\n\n<p>Now, while there are many who can do the same things on SO, and those that have even more ability if they have over 10K using the admin tools, it's not the fact that I use these tools that I believe makes me a good candidate.  It's the fact that I believe it is my <em>responsibility</em> to use these tools to contribute to a healthy ecosystem that makes me a good candidate.</p>\n\n<p>Being nominated (and hopefully, elected) to a moderator would help further my ability to fulfil that responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for your consideration and best wishes to everyone that is nominated.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Looking at some of the other nominations, it appears that I haven't engaged in enough politicking and elaborated on what I feel the responsibilities of a modeator are and how I would fulfil them.</p>\n\n<p>I've touched on it breifly in stating the importance of maintaining the health of the ecosystem and that as a part of that community, I have a responsibility to contribute to that goal.</p>\n\n<p>As far as a specific guideline as to <em>how</em> that will be achieved, I think that <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/posts/39457/revisions\">Chip Uni</a> came the closest on <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com\">meta</a> with his reply to the question <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39405/moderator-accountability-request/39457#39457\">\"Moderator Accountability Request.\"</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In my opinion, moderators should <strong>only</strong> do what the rest of the community cannot.</p>\n  \n  <p>Stack Overflow does not need a moderator to close down somewhat-questionable \n  questions. Dozens of 3000+ reputation users already rapidly vote to close down questions. \n  Let the community make those decisions. </p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, plenty of things can't be done by non-moderators. \n  We need you to look for suspicious voting patterns. We need you to be a <strong>neutral</strong> arbiter. \n  We need you to use the tools that you have, and that we don't.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I absolutely agree with this, and <strong>doing the work that other users cannot</strong> would be my <strong>first priority every time I am on SO</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>That's not to say that I would not contribute in non-moderator ways to the community.  However, when doing so, I would not use the abilities of a moderator to hasten a result that the community will come to on its own.</p>\n\n<p>An example would be voting to close a thread.  If I see that a thread has three votes to close, I will not auto-close it, the community is trending in that direction, and the community should be the arbiter of that decision.</p>\n\n<p>If I have a personal opinion that the thread should be closed, I'll do what everyone else does, cast my vote to close, and move on.</p>\n\n<p>And since I didn't mention this before, if there are specific questions that you have, feel free to post them in the comments, and I'll adjust my nomination accordingly to answer.</p>",

    "body": "<p>My name is <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/419/kev\">Kevin Kenny</a>, I work as a software developer for a UK web hosting company. I've <a href=\"http://careers.stackoverflow.com/kev\">worked in the IT industry</a> for a <em>long</em> time having been a field engineer, data centre ops supervisor and now for the past few years a software developer. In addition I also architected much of our IIS7 environment and provide third line support for ASP.NET for when the front line guys reach the boundaries of their knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>I've been a Stack Overflow user since the closed beta and over the past two years and five months have been an active participant on the site. I've decided to throw my hat into the ring this year because I think I've now got a good handle on the way the community works and the type of site Stack Overflow aims to be and I think I'd be a good moderator.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a bit of a Windows generalist on Stack Overflow but specifically follow the IIS related tags because that's what I spend a lot of time writing code against.</p>\n\n<p>As a moderator I will always allow the community at-large to decide what is good and what is bad using the conventions and tools available to it - the FAQ, voting, flagging, the close button. However the flagging tools are there for a reason and will act on these notifications sensibly. I don't have a power-hungry bone in my body but do like to see things done the right way and in a fair way. I'm also not a pedant or literalist, and do have the ability to read between the lines rather than take things just on face-value.</p>\n\n<p>So rather than ramble on any further I thought I'd compile a list of what I think is good about me and of course a list of the bad.</p>\n\n<p>The Good Stuff:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I have the patience of a saint - I'm happy to spend time fixing up really broken questions and answers where the english is almost indecipherable and I'm looking at a code formatting disaster.</li>\n<li>I often spend quite a bit of time now merging OP content in answers that doesn't belong into chronologically sane \"updates\" in the original question.</li>\n<li>I'm not afraid to politely nudge other users (new users and old-hands alike) where it looks like there's a comment bun fight about to begin and ask them nicely to calm down a bit.</li>\n<li>I can't abide rudeness - especially to users where it's abundantly clear their english is weak. I find it disappointing when I see 2k+ users who's first language is english preferring to insult rather than use their new found edit privilege to try and improve a post.</li>\n<li>I can't abide officious, condescending and patronising comments.</li>\n<li>I use my moderator flags heavily.</li>\n<li>I work from home and can spend quite a bit of time on Stack Overflow. You can usually see me from around 09:30 until 02:30 UTC and at weekends, so I think my availability is good</li>\n<li>I can spot a subjective/flamewar question a mile away.</li>\n<li>In my day job I deal with all sorts of customers, from the clueless, the irrational, the smartass to the old-hats and folks who know what they're doing. This is via our support system, emails and telephone. I guess the point being is that I don't live in a cave and can actually communicate well under all sorts of circumstances.</li>\n<li>I'm a huge believer in the \"be nice\" philosophy in the FAQ and will often cheerfully refer other users to this essential guideline if I see something brewing.</li>\n<li>I'm not afraid to admit when I don't know the answer and will happily consult others before taking a unilateral decision that might affect others negatively.</li>\n<li>I'm happy to be proved wrong.</li>\n<li>I like rainbows and waffles.</li>\n<li>I'm human.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Bad Stuff:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've not always been a good citizen and did participate (to my shame) in some edit wars with certain individuals back in the early days.</li>\n<li>I've not always been in agreement with Jeff+Team and have perhaps \"shouted\" my difference of opinion a bit louder than was necessary, and perhaps with hindsight crossing the border into being insulting. I'm not proud of this.</li>\n<li>I have once emailed team@stackoverflow.com to apologise and promise \"not do it again\".</li>\n<li>I don't always concur with some of the views on Meta. That said, if a policy or the will of the community has been accepted then I'll abide by these conventions - I used to see no harm in salutations and sigs. Now they get removed if I'm editing a post.</li>\n<li>I probably don't spend enough time in \"chat\", but then time spent chatting isn't time spent answering questions, removing cruft and fixing posts.</li>\n<li>I sometimes like my cheese left where it is, and not a millimeter out of place</li>\n<li>I've downvoted Jon Skeet</li>\n<li>I don't like unicorns or ponies</li>\n<li>I'm human.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So community, here I am warts and all, I hope you'll consider me worthy material to be a Stack Overflow moderator.</p>",

I do genuinely like this site and what it does, and find myself spending a lot of time on it. If I am able to help the moderators with my spare time, I think that is a win.

I want a bigger part in this bright future.</p>\n\n<p>I would like to say that I've always been the poster child for best behavior, but I'm human. You'll find comments on this site which plainly tells people that they're barking up the wrong tree. However, I put much effort into my work on this site, evident in answers such as <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5727/what-are-the-barriers-to-understanding-pointers-and-what-can-be-done-to-overcome/5754#5754\">What are the barriers to understanding pointers and what can be done to overcome them?</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/143552/comparing-date-ranges/143568#143568\">Comparing date ranges</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, neither of those two answers, or any of my other answers, should have much of an impact on whether you should vote on me, since I will still be answering questions on Stack Overflow, regardless of how this election turns out. Also, the work a moderator is required to perform does not hinge on the ability to provide great answers.</p>\n\n<p>So, I nominate myself.</p>\n\n<p>As qualifications, unverifiable as they are by you, the votee, I will mention my 12-year position as board member of the housing complex I live in (32 apartments), so I have some experience with handling things that aren't always cut and dry. People are human, as the saying goes.</p>\n\n<p>As for moderation...</p>\n\n<p>Moderators needs to be the voice of the community. They need to handle the things the community cannot, but which the community would, if they could. This means they have to handle the rough edges, cut the diamond so to speak, by using the moderator tools that aren't available to the rest of the community.</p>\n\n<p>Moderators have power, but with power comes responsibility. To moderate a SE site means wielding that power with a light touch, and only apply pressure when needed.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I would not jump right into it. I would flex the moderator muscles little by little in order to ease into the role, leaning on the other moderators and Meta for advice and guidance.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, thanks for your time, now <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/review\">back the regular program</a>.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/222028\">Rocket's answers to your questions</a></strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Hello there, my name is Rocket Hazmat (ok fine, my name is Eric) and I want to be a moderator.  I have been a member of this site for over 4 years and I am active in the <a href=\"/questions/tagged/php\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;php&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">php</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/javascript\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">javascript</a>, and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/mysql\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;mysql&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">mysql</a> tags.  I work full time as a web developer and I'd love to use my free time to be a moderator here (I already use that free time to answer questions).</p>\n\n<p>This site has been very helpful to me.  I've asked questions here when stuck on projects and have always gotten an answer, or at least pointed in the right direction.  I have given back by answering all the questions I can, I love to help.  But now, I feel it's time that I put more of my energy, love, and dedication into this site, and that's why I want to be a moderator.</p>\n\n<p>If elected, I pledge to help keep StackOverflow safe, clean, and friendly!  I know how to vote on posts (you click the arrow, right?), and will down-vote a bad one when I see it, but I don't like to be mean.  I try to explain why I am down-voting and want to help the member fix their post.  We're not here to be strict and ban you when you mis-behave.  We are here to help keep everything nice and neat and make everyone feel welcome.</p>\n\n<p>Also, I like ponies.</p>",

    "title": "",
    "body": "<p>I've been a Stack Overflow user for two years, as well as an avid user of <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/50049/tim-post?tab=accounts\">several other Stack Exchange web sites</a>. I'm a retired pro-tem moderator from Webmasters SE and did my very best to help turn it into a successful site. At the time, moderator nominations were conducted on individual meta sites, I was nominated and accepted. Unfortunately, this collided with a life altering job change and schedule. Things have settled again, and I miss moderating. I was also the operator of a (now defunct) SE 1.0 site. I had the idea that a SE site for startup companies would work, so did several other people. </p>\n\n<p>One of the things that attracts me to Stack Overflow and other sites in the network is that the <em>community</em> runs pretty much everything. My view on moderation is that we're here to do what the <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/39405/moderator-accountability-request/39457#39457\">community <em>can't</em></a>, while giving a bit of time to behind the scenes maintenance and upkeep to ensure that all visitors have the best possible experience.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest difference in my opinion between moderators and users, beyond access to special privileges, is accountability. I'm ready and willing to be held accountable for every action that I take as a moderator. I think it is an absurdity to expect that everyone will like <em>every</em> action that you take as a moderator. I really value this community, and I will work to ensure it continues to thrive. That might mean locking something that found its way into StumbleUpon and received fifteen 'thank you' answers in an hour, or letting someone know through a variety of available tools that their behavior simply isn't acceptable for our community. I'm confident that the majority of my time will be spent doing more rewarding things, like asking people heavily vested in tags that lack tag wikis to create them.</p>\n\n<p>Typically, I let the community speak with their votes and flags before taking action unless I'm certain that not taking action immediately would be detrimental to the community. Examples would be obvious SPAM or blatantly abusive behavior. </p>\n\n<p>I don't have as much free time as many others, but I do spend a significant amount of what time I have on SO. If elected, that time would be even more productive. I tend to be on-line approximately 15 hours a day, active on SO and other SE sites at least 3 hours daily. My Skype ID as well a a link to a page that sends me e-mail is on my profile.</p>\n\n<p>A little about me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Husband &amp; Father</li>\n<li>I work in the web hosting industry - That 'cloud' thing. Mostly I work on low level tools, APIs kernels and hypervisors.</li>\n<li>Home is both US and Asia. We try our very best to visit a new country every year</li>\n<li>I speak English , relatively broken Spanish and enough Tagalog (Filipino) to get by</li>\n<li>I've been programming for over 20 years, 10 professionally</li>\n<li>Avid amateur photographer who is ashamed to have little activity on photography SE</li>\n<li>Free / Open Source software developer (yes, I have commit access to projects that aren't mine)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Notable badges:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Suffrage (I tend to use all of my votes, frequently, it's not like they roll over)</li>\n<li>Strunk &amp; White (I just can't help it)</li>\n<li>Electorate (I love questions that give me something to do or think about)</li>\n<li>Sportsmanship (I usually up vote answers before adding something I feel is missing)</li>\n<li>Pundit (here and on MSO)</li>\n<li>Convention (I tend to be quite vocal in the shaping of Stack Exchange)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Why do I want to be a moderator?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Every time I see something that should be fixed, I feel like I'm adding to someone else's work load by just flagging it. I'm a 10k+ user which means I should be able to fix most things, but the sheer volume of SO is quite taxing. This is equally compounded by knowing how odd flags can be.</li>\n<li>SO needs diplomatic hands. I know the tools, I know how things work, I have a very good idea of how people work and I want to help.</li>\n<li>I am a 3k + user on several other sites and can help guide question migration.</li>\n<li>I'm not easily offended or disturbed, and there apparently was an opening</li>\n<li>SO is a source of fun for me, I want to help improve it</li>\n<li>I've moderated before and I fully know what the job entails.</li>\n<li>Moderators should first and foremost <em>want</em> the responsibility. I do and I know what I'm getting myself into.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most memorable SO experience:</p>\n\n<p>I helped to translate a question that was asked in Spanish. Someone arrived here and Chrome translated the page, so naturally, they asked a question in Spanish. A few of us pulled it out of down vote city, translated it and it actually ended up getting good answers. Now, I can't remember which one it was, but it is in my history for the morbidly curious. As broken as my Spanish is, it felt good to know enough to help someone.</p>\n\n<p>Low and behold, despite all of that, I'm a POSIX/*NIX programmer who doesn't have a generalist badge :) How could that <em>possibly</em> happen?</p>",

There are 114.8K questions in the Close Votes review queue. If that sounds like way too many, you want me in there clearing those instead of adding 50 more questions a day from the New Questions page to the queue and having no votes left to do reviews (although I'll occasionally still go through the queue and Skip the bad questions and vote to Leave Open the good ones, because I feel that any dent made to the queue improves reviewer morale and will lead to more people reviewing more close votes...)</p>\n\n<p>I believe in good tagging. I work in library metadata, and I know that information is useless if it's hard to find. I'm proud of my work to stop people trying to make <a href=\"/questions/tagged/ar\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;ar&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">ar</a> mean <a href=\"/questions/tagged/augmented-reality\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;augmented-reality&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">augmented-reality</a> instead of the static library archiving tool. Until <a href=\"/questions/tagged/google\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;google&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">google</a> got blacklisted and <a href=\"/questions/tagged/app\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;app&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">app</a> got burninated, I worked to keep <a href=\"/questions/tagged/google-app-engine\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;google-app-engine&#39;\" rel=\"tag\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vobok.png\" height=\"16\" width=\"18\" alt=\"\" class=\"sponsor-tag-img\">google-app-engine</a> one single tag. I haven't even used Xcode in several years, and I still remove <a href=\"/questions/tagged/xcode\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;xcode&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">xcode</a> when I see it misused.</p>\n\n<p>A vote for me is a vote for a clean, organized, usable site.</p>",

Of the hundreds of flags I've cast over the past year, only two were declined. I hope this portrays me as someone who's well acquainted with the site rules. While I'm more inclined towards \"field work\", i.e., reviewing posts as I discover them (often within the first seconds of their existence), I will focus on the moderator flag queue if elected.</p>\n\n<p>I participate in Meta (mostly silently), help managing the Python chat room on this site and expect to collaborate with the community more closely as a moderator.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, I have a lot of time to moderate on both weekdays and weekends, and would improve the moderator coverage in Eastern Europe.</p>",

    "body": "<p>I'd like to <em>-ahem-</em> humbly nominate myself for a moderator position on Stack Overflow. Although I've been a member for more than two years (since May 2009), I've only been active starting May 2010. That said, I've been <em>extremely active</em>, and I do somehow have <em>two</em> Yearling badges!</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, first off, I'm <strong>19 years old</strong>, and I live in <strong>Singapore</strong>. So, I hail from the other side of the world \u2014 for many of you, anyway. If you think about timezone issues with users, questions and answers around the site, that may be a good or bad thing (I'm in UTC+8). I also happen to be <a href=\"http://data.stackexchange.com/stackoverflow/s/802/top-users-singapore\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the top user in my country by reputation</a>! I spend much more time on the site answering questions compared to other active Singaporean SE users like <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/313758/yi-jiang\">Yi Jiang</a>, but we all contribute in our own ways to the same site(s) as a whole, which is nice :)</p>\n\n<p>In terms of tags, you'll often find me answering questions about:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Frontend web development, which includes <a href=\"/questions/tagged/html\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;html&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">html</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/css\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;css&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">css</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/javascript\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;javascript&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">javascript</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/jquery\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;jquery&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">jquery</a>.</li>\n<li>Web development with <a href=\"/questions/tagged/php\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;php&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">php</a>, where I'd been less active lately but I'm returning to.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/questions/tagged/ios\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;ios&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">ios</a> development with <a href=\"/questions/tagged/objective-c\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;objective-c&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">objective-c</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/cocoa-touch\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;cocoa-touch&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">cocoa-touch</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%23\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c#&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c#</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/.net\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;.net&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">.net</a>, with which I have relatively less experience; don't ask me how I got that <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/badges/40/c-sharp?userid=106224\">gold</a> <a href=\"/questions/tagged/c%23\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;c#&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">c#</a> badge...</li>\n<li>A little bit of <a href=\"/questions/tagged/actionscript-3\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;actionscript-3&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">actionscript-3</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/flash\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;flash&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">flash</a> as well. Unless you recognize me from <a href=\"http://boltclock.newgrounds.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elsewhere on the Internet</a>, it may surprise you that I've known and used Flash longer than PHP! Mostly for animation, though.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You may also, or otherwise, know me on Stack Overflow for:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>My \"specialty tag\", <a href=\"/questions/tagged/css-selectors\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;css-selectors&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">css-selectors</a> (over 1000 questions total, <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=user:106224+%5Bcss-selectors%5D\">over 20% answered by me</a>)</li>\n<li>This question: <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/q/3009380/106224\">What&#39;s the shebang/hashbang (#!) in Facebook and new Twitter URLs for?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I also carry out retags (<strong>lots and lots</strong> of retags on <a href=\"/questions/tagged/html5\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;html5&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">html5</a><a href=\"/questions/tagged/css3\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;css3&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">css3</a> questions...), formatting edits, link fixes and others such in the aforementioned tags, so it's not just answering questions. In fact, I'm recently finding myself commenting and editing more than answering \u2014 so much that I've been among <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users?tab=editors&amp;filter=all\">the top 20 editors of all time</a> for a while!</p>\n\n<p>Not that less or more of either is better, of course. However, as a moderator I believe I can be more efficient than ever with post revisions and other janitorial duties, as I continue with my question-answering business. While I actively add fresh content to the site, I'd love to help out with cleaning and polishing our currently-existing posts. \"Dust tends to settle\", and all that jazz.</p>\n\n<p>I visit meta once in a while, but most of my time spent there is with questions and on voting on other posts. I'm trying to answer more meta questions!</p>\n\n<p>In terms of flags, my flag weight is about <strong>670</strong> right now. I'll often flag bad posts that I come across while doing cleanup work, as well as posts where drama is brewing. Admittedly, the mod queue has been quite a turn-off for me with that consistently large number on the top bar; that's one reason why I feel bad about raising flags at times. Consequently, as a regular user, I also feel bad about being unable to help the existing moderators in dealing with the mod queue directly.</p>\n\n<p>In short: I'm tired of raising flags (and I can't hold a candle to Brad Larson in that aspect!), and want to start resolving them. I imagine it'll be a challenge, again given that consistently large number up at the top, but I'd like to help out however I can.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I felt I <em>had</em> to bring up: you probably know me for leaving comments almost everywhere. And, well, you may know me for being quite snarky with my comments sometimes. I'm very much aware of that. But I'm doing my best to change that over time, because I'm frankly not liking the way I'm sometimes treating others either. If <em>anything else</em>, my reputation is at stake too :P And besides, moderators are humans too, right? (Well, except <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/1288/bill-the-lizard\">Bill the Lizard</a>, maybe <em>-shrug-</em>)</p>\n\n<p>Oh and yes, I'll continue to be active here in the coming months. My visit streak is at <strong>348 days</strong> as of this nomination phase, just less than three weeks shy of a full year! The last time I broke that streak was last November, when I went under the knife after being found with appendicitis. I'm not usually this sick, but obviously that was one time I was definitely not supposed to be here ;) I'm OK now, though!</p>\n\n<p>Last but not least, at the end of the day I'm only sincerely hoping to improve myself so I can do a much more effective job at lending myself to improving the site for the rest of us. Whether I'm a moderator or not, though, I shall continue to contribute to the site to the best of my efforts and my ability. I'll definitely work to prove myself either way, and if I get chosen as a moderator this round or in the future, that'll certainly be another privilege, on top of one I already have of working with Stack Overflow itself.</p>",

I see that as a good thing - I'm now far more prepared to be a Stack Overflow moderator than I was before.</p>\n\n<p>As some of you may know, I'm a moderator over on Stack Overflow's softer side, <a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com\">Programmers</a>. You can check out my <a href=\"http://programmers.stackexchange.com/users/226/anna-lear?tab=activity\">activity stream</a> there and get a pretty good picture of my moderation style and commitment to meeting the guidelines set out in the <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/\">Theory of Moderation</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I monitor flag queues daily, check 10k tools, suggested edits queue, and of course the front page itself. My reputation gain has significantly slowed down since I became a moderator and I even lost a bunch of rep once we started clearing out older, now-significantly-offtopic questions. I'm always putting my duties as a moderator first and personal gains second.</p>\n\n<p>I've worked with Stack Overflow moderators over the last 10 months or so and I know how much work is involved and how complex and/or tedious certain issues can be. I think I'm up to the challenge. I have all the requisite badges (including the two that were dropped from the criteria) and I'm <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/155160/anna-lear\">quite active</a> on Meta. I also have the time.</p>\n\n<p>My SO rep leaves a bit to be desired, but I check in daily now both looking for questions to answer, questions that are possibly better asked on Programmers, and questions and answers that otherwise need attention. I gained roughly 2300 reputation since the last SO election, which perhaps isn't much but it's certainly a move in the right direction. :)</p>\n\n<p>I know there's been some tension between Programmers and Stack Overflow, and I think it'd be kinda neat to have a moderator who's very well familiar with both sites and the rest of the network. I think I could be that moderator. </p>\n\n<p>P.S. In the interest of full disclosure, I'm also a pro tem moderator on <a href=\"http://literature.stackexchange.com\">Literature</a>. It requires very little moderation however, unlike the bigger sites in the network.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are you sure you want to handle the moderation load (and abuse by non-content users) of two sites at once?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, I'm sure. I have the time to devote to it and the abuse doesn't bother me much. Outright abuse is actually fairly rare and the rest of the time it's just people wondering why a decision has been made. I can always explain my thought process for any action as a moderator and I'm happy to revert actions that turned out to be in error, so I think things work out well in the end.</p>",

A few months after that announcement, I entered the private beta and immediately knew that this site was going to be something special. It has grown to be valuable to so many, and I'd like to help that continue.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/a/224922\">I've demonstrated that I don't like to risk losing useful content</a>. Help me save more of it.</strong> I make a particular promise: if elected, I will monitor the deletion log, undeletion vote log, and edits to recently-deleted questions. Any deserving questions I see will be restored immediately, instead of waiting and hoping for high-rep users to bring them back.</p>\n\n<p>Has this ever happened to you? After carefully considering a problem you conclude that you need to do <code>X</code>. You post a question asking \"How do I do X?\". Instead of relevant responses, you get a dozen commenters telling you <em>\"you're doing it wrong\"</em>. You try to explain, but by the time you respond your question has been closed as a \"duplicate\" of something entirely unrelated. Elect me so that I can reopen these questions and set things straight.</p>",

After crossing the 10k reputation threshold, I've found myself spending more time performing the janitorial work of editing posts, flagging spam, and identifying duplicate or inappropriate content than answering questions.</p>\n\n<p>My areas of expertise are in iOS and Mac development (I'm currently the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/tags/iphone/topusers\">top user in the <code>[iphone]</code> tag</a>, as well as several related ones), and I have taken a particular interest in cleaning up content within those areas.  The <code>[iphone]</code> tag is the 8th most popular one on the site, and as such it attracts a lot of duplicate questions and other items that need moderation.  However, there aren't enough users with voting privileges that frequent these tags to manage the flood of new questions there.</p>\n\n<p>I believe that I have been professional and polite in my dealings with people here.  If there is any kernel of utility in a poorly worded question, I try to clean it up rather than downvote it or try to close it.  I also recognize the value of user-created content, and only vote to delete a question if I feel neither it nor its answers have any redeeming value whatsoever.  Finally, the other moderators can probably tell you how many times I've annoyed them with my various flags for items that I couldn't clean up myself.</p>\n\n<p>For those concerned about the relatively high number of downvotes in my profile, a significant number come from the janitorial work I've done since gaining access to the 10k tools a year ago.  I don't care much about my reputation now, so I have no problems in downvoting spam, offensive, or otherwise unsalvageable content that others simply leave to be deleted.  In fact, looking at a recalculated reputation report shows that only 614 of the downvotes I've cast are still counted, meaning that ~70% of the material I've downvoted has since been deleted from the site (ignoring the few CW items I've voted on).  I've also described <a href=\"http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/61596/why-are-people-allowed-to-downvote-0-voted-questions-without-giving-a-reason/61607#61607\">here</a> the situations in which I've used downvotes within the tags I frequent.</p>\n\n<p>The time I spend on Stack Overflow causes no problems with my employer, being that I'm a cofounder of the company, so I would be able to help at regular times throughout the U.S. Central Time work day in addition to off hours.</p>\n\n<p>Again, I've enjoyed participating on Stack Overflow and would like a chance to help the site stay an incredible resource for programmers going forward.</p>",

I've benefited both from answers to my questions as well as lessons learned from answering others.  I'd like to help the site remain the best programming resource out there by keeping it clean as it continues to grow.</p>\n\n<p>My area of expertise on Stack Overflow is on the Apple side of development, in particular their iOS devices.  I am currently the top all-time user in the <a href=\"/questions/tagged/iphone\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'iphone'\" rel=\"tag\">iphone</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/ios\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged 'ios'\" rel=\"tag\">ios</a>, and a few related tags.  While I enjoy developing for Mac and iOS right now, I work with many platforms on a regular basis and believe that specific technologies are less important than the real-world problems you are trying to solve with them.</p>\n\n<p>However, my questions and answers are not why I believe I am qualified to be a moderator.  Lately, I've found myself spending far more time performing janitorial work, by flagging, casting close votes, and, when appropriate, voting to delete exceptionally bad content.  </p>\n\n<p>As of this writing, I've cast 6870 flags, with 2468 of those deemed helpful, 6 declined, and 8 disputed (the rest were cast before these stats were counted).  I've flagged 1493 instances of spam, and was one of the first users to receive the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/badges/1298/marshal\">Marshal</a> badge.  I believe I've shown that I can identify material which is inappropriate for the site, but rather than jam up the moderation queue with flags, I'd be glad to help process them and take some of the load off of the existing moderators.</p>\n\n<p>For content that can be salvaged, I've spent a significant amount of time editing questions into shape.  I have the <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/badges/223/copy-editor\">Copy Editor</a> badge and I am more than happy to find questions with rough English, but a good core problem, and turn them into something that attracts votes and quality answers.</p>\n\n<p>I'm a cofounder of the company I work at, so they're not going to fire me for the time I spend on the site.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, I believe that I've always been polite and professional when dealing with people here on Stack Overflow.  A moderator needs to maintain a cool head, and I believe that I would be able to do so if elected.</p>",

Or from my involvement on <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com\">Meta</a>, and maybe for my work on StackWrap4J on StackApps.  I hope I have left a good impression and don't need to make a case for moderator.</p>\n\n<p>But the vast majority of you probably don't recognize me.  So, this is for you:</p>\n\n<p>I have been a part of this community since the very beginning. (Well almost.  I joined near the tail end of the private beta.)  I have been consistently visited this site for ~2.5 years, so I know how this community works inside and out.  While I primarily answer questions in the Java and C# tags I view a high volume of questions in other tags.  I am always up for learning new things.</p>\n\n<p><em>If you are interested in a more in-depth look into what I think it takes to be a moderator, please see <a href=\"http://goo.gl/o8vcq\" rel=\"nofollow\">my first blog post ever!</a> (I didn't want to make this any longer than I already have.)</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>I am very excited to have this opportunity to run for moderator on this awesome site.</strong>  I would love to join the ranks of Bill the Lizard, Michael Myers, and all of the rest.  They do such a great job with the community already and it would be an honor to be listed among them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My theory on moderation is that less is more.</strong>  Moderators don't decide the direction the community takes.  Their goal is to speak for the community and uphold the principles that it has decided are important.  </p>\n\n<p>As a moderator I will work hard to keep the site clean.  I will make sure that I moderate fairly.  I will often ask for advice from senior moderators.  They will be my role models.  </p>\n\n<p>I'm not afraid to make the tough calls though.  If something doesn't belong on the site, I will vote to move it.  Negative comments creating a negative environment - I will remove them.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, I feel like I am a great candidate.  I know how the site works.  I am fair and unbiased.  I am dedicated to making this site a success.  I am also willing to listen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><sub>tldr version, read the <strong>bold</strong> text.</sub></p>\n\n<p><strong>Vote for me!</strong></p>\n\n<p>I would also like to mention that I am always around.  I have currently visited the site 197 days in a row. (And I plan on keeping up that streak.)  I will be available to deal with issues often - not just at select times during the week.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you'd like more information, directions on how to contact me are in my profile.  Feel free to drop me a line.</p>",

I'm an avid <a href=\"/questions/tagged/open-source\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;open-source&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">open-source</a>, <a href=\"/questions/tagged/unit-testing\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;unit-testing&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">unit-testing</a> and Iron Maiden enthusiast, not necessarily in that order. I believe that toughest skill a software engineer can master is removing code, and I pride myself on having a negative net contribution in terms of LOC in any project I'm involved in a major way (while delivering useful features, of course).</p>\n\n<h1>Thoughts about Stack Overflow</h1>\n\n<p>As long as it's within the On Topic list, we should be moderating the form of the content, not the content itself. SO should be a place where any programming enthusiast feels welcome, regardless of their level of experience. Having said that, content should be presented in a way that makes it easy to consume and discuss. Questions like \"Give me the codez for loop!!1\" shouldn't be removed because the OP doesn't know how to use a <code>for</code> loop, they should be removed because OP didn't even make an honest attempt to participate in this community. I believe that if we aren't welcoming to novice programmers, we're missing our mark, and as a moderator, that's what I would like to concentrate on.</p>",

You may look at my profile for the former in detail, but at least a few of the latter are necessary, so here's why I would be a good moderator:</p>\n\n<h3>I have lots of time to moderate.</h3>\n\n<p>I've visited Stack Overflow for 404 days out of less than 425 that I've been registered, with 270 of those days being consecutive. During the average of 3 hours daily I spend on Stack Overflow, I actively answer questions and seek out terrible questions to close and non-answers to delete, spam to clean up and misguided Facebook users to redirect.</p>\n\n<h3>I make the right decisions.</h3>\n\n<p>The only \"proof\" of this is 1234 helpful flags, 20 declined, all but one of which were long in the past. But I've never closed anything unfairly and I've never downvoted for any of the wrong reasons.</p>\n\n<h3>I always prefer to clean up than erase.</h3>\n\n<p>There's no feeling better than a huge edit!</p>\n\n<h3>Whatever the outcome, I can still help without being a moderator.</h3>\n\n<p>Anybody with more than 20,000 reputation gets access to a wide range of moderator tools, which I've used. Lots. <strong>But I'd like to make a bigger impact.</strong> Please consider me, and thank you Stack Overflow.</p>",

Zentgraf, web developer from Germany.</p>\n\n<p>I've been here a while and have seen Stack Overflow grow from its beta stage to fulfilling its declared goal of being the de facto standard place to find solutions for programming problems. It has absolutely revolutionised this little corner of the internet, and it is truly important to preserve it and its original goal of being a knowledge base for everyone. There truly is no viable alternative anywhere close, Stack Overflow has become an institution almost inseparable from the profession of programming at this point in time.</p>\n\n<p>Through the years I've witnessed the ups and downs and policy changes the site went through, and I'm pretty optimistic about the current relatively stable state the community has reached. The overall mood is generally productive, and although there's a constant need for moderation, this is typically happening smoothly and efficiently. I'd like to help keep it that way and keep improving and tweaking the formula wherever possible and necessary.</p>\n\n<p>You'll find my in-depth answers to the questionnaire here: <a href=\"http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337653/476\">http://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/337653/476</a></p>",

In fact I've flagged probably over 200 NAA answers and have had them deleted.</p></li>\n<li><p>I'd like to help out closing and leaving open questions in the CV queue more.

In fact, Undo, ManishEarth and I have generated a tool to get rid of these comments. Being a mod would make me be able to get rid of these comments without mass-flagging, and more than 100 a day.</p></li>\n<li><p>I like to remove bad tags and edit questions. Being able to do mod work with bad tags would be great.

I find that 'teaching' is the sometimes the best way of learning - I like answering questions that lie just on the edges of my knowledge, forcing me to learn just a little more. Sometimes your initial thoughts about the 'best' answer are proved wrong as you craft the perfect reply, or you realise someone else's answer is far better than your own!</p>\n\n<p><strong>But what of moderation?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I'd like to think I would be a very light handed moderator. Quick to remove obvious abuses, but in more nuanced problems I'm able to see both sides of the story. </p>\n\n<p>I have a great deal of experience with such diplomacy - I helped to run a website called Geograph.org.uk, which collects geographical photographs of the UK. I handled all of the complaints raised by landowners concerned about photographs, some of whom were irate, threatening and abusive. I would adjudicate with calm, measured communications: sometimes siding with the photographer, sometimes with the landowner, but almost always to satisfaction of both parties.

Instead of summarizing all the goods or bads (yep no one is perfect) I'd like you to rather visit my <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/2140173/mehow\">SO</a>, META, and Careers profiles for details. I spend ~30 hrs/wk here and could use a few of those towards some more responsible tasks.</p>",

    "body": "<blockquote>\n  <p>The Spring Framework supports\n  integration with Hibernate, Java\n  Persistence API (JPA), Java Data\n  Objects (JDO) and iBATIS SQL Maps for\n  resource management, data access\n  object (DAO) implementations, and\n  transaction strategies. For example,\n  for Hibernate there is first-class\n  support with several convenient IoC\n  features that address many typical\n  Hibernate integration issues. You can\n  configure all of the supported\n  features for O/R (object relational)\n  mapping tools through Dependency\n  Injection. They can participate in\n  Spring's resource and transaction\n  management, and they comply with\n  Spring's generic transaction and DAO\n  exception hierarchies. The recommended\n  integration style is to code DAOs\n  against plain Hibernate, JPA, and JDO\n  APIs. The older style of using\n  Spring's DAO templates is no longer\n  recommended; however, coverage of this\n  style can be found in the Section A.1,\n  <a href=\"http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/classic-spring.html#classic-spring-orm\" rel=\"nofollow\">\u201cClassic ORM usage\u201d</a> in the\n  appendices.</p>\n  \n  <p>Spring adds significant enhancements\n  to the ORM layer of your choice when\n  you create data access applications.\n  You can leverage as much of the\n  integration support as you wish, and\n  you should compare this integration\n  effort with the cost and risk of\n  building a similar infrastructure\n  in-house. You can use much of the ORM\n  support as you would a library,\n  regardless of technology, because\n  everything is designed as a set of\n  reusable JavaBeans. ORM in a Spring\n  IoC container facilitates\n  configuration and deployment. Thus\n  most examples in this section show\n  configuration inside a Spring\n  container.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Source:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/orm.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spring Reference: Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Data Access</a></p>",

    "body": "<h2>About Rails</h2>\n\n<p>Rails is a framework built on Ruby that provides developers and easy way to build an full-featured application. It is popular among many developers from novices to experiences developers working for large corporations. In short, it utilizes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93View%E2%80%93Controller\" rel=\"nofollow\">MVC fundamentals</a> and lives by the phrase 'convention over configuration' (CoC) and 'don't repeat yourself' (DRY). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Rails 3</h2>\n\n<p>Rails 3 is the most recent version of the Rails framework and provides a few upgrades and differences from its predecessors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brand new router with an emphasis on RESTful declarations</li>\n<li>New Action Mailer API modeled after Action Controller</li>\n<li>New Active Record chainable query language built on top of relational algebra</li>\n<li>Unobtrusive JavaScript helpers with drivers for Prototype and jQuery</li>\n<li>Explicit dependency management with Bundler</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are cited from the <a href=\"http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rails 3 release notes</a>. Some other new features include a better console environment. You can now start the rails server, console, etc using the alias <code>rails</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>rails s          #starts rails server\nrails server     #starts rails server\nrails c          #starts rails console\nrails console    #starts rails console\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>For more information on changes, see the [Rails 3 release notes].<a href=\"http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Caveats</h2>\n\n<p>This is such a huge topic that it's actually worth mentioning in this wiki. All too often, Rails is compared to another popular web-founded programming language - <a href=\"http://php.net\" rel=\"nofollow\">PHP</a>. Despite what you may hear, there is no competition between PHP and Rails.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, PHP is often directly compared to Rails in terms of efficiency, usability, scalability, etc. This is an entirely unfair comparison. Rails (actually Ruby on Rails) is a <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework\" rel=\"nofollow\">framework</a></strong> built on Ruby. If you read an article comparing Rails and PHP, the article is unfounded. </p>\n\n<p>To adequately compare the two languages, one must either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>compare PHP and Ruby</li>\n<li>compare Rails and a PHP framework like <a href=\"http://codeigniter.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">CodeIgniter</a> or <a href=\"http://cakephp.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CakePHP</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Please keep this is mind in literature you come across in your development.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Helpful Links</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://guides.rubyonrails.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">The official RoR guides</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://railscasts.com/tags/27\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rails 3 specific Railscasts by Ryan Bates</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/dashboard\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rails 3 Git Log/Bugs</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rails 3 release notes</a></li>\n</ul>",

Editing is encouraged!</p>\n\n<p>Some common reasons to edit are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to fix grammatical or spelling mistakes</li>\n<li>to clarify the meaning of a post without changing it</li>\n<li>to correct minor mistakes or add addendums / updates as the post ages</li>\n<li>to add related resources or hyperlinks</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Try to make the post substantively better when you edit, not just change a single character. Tiny, trivial edits are discouraged.</p>\n\n<h3>How do I edit posts?</h3>\n\n<p>The <code>edit</code> link is available under each post.</p>\n\n<h3>What happens when I edit a post?</h3>\n\n<p>The post will be updated to show the latest editor, as well as the original author. All edits are saved and tracked in a revision history with attribution to each editor. </p>\n\n<p>The revision history can be viewed by clicking the date and time next to the edited post (e.g. \"edited 3 days ago\").</p>\n\n<p>Editing a post also bumps the question to the top of the homepage. Too many edits can also force a post into <a href=\"/privileges/community-wiki\">community wiki mode</a>. Make your edits count.</p>\n\n<h3>Reviewing suggested edits</h3>\n\n<p>In addition, users with this privilege level also get access to the suggested edits queue. The queue has a list of posts which have been edited upon by users who don't have edit privileges. This queue can be accessed over at the <a href=\"/review/suggested-edits\">suggested edits tab in the review section</a>.<br>\nUsers with this privilege level get access to the <a href=\"/review/low-quality-posts\">Low Quality Posts</a> list where they can improve the low quality posts, or suggest they are deleted.</p>",

Now i move the package, the .dtsx file, to the server which is a 64bit window 2008 box, it stops working. The problem is that package default to sqlserver driver instead of mysql drive. I have to move the whole project to the server from local machine and open the project to make it pick up mysql driver, then it will work. Is there a way i can develop on my loca machine but run on the server without having to open the project to pick up the right driver? thanks</p>",

I know this a bit unusual, but its a relatively simple model and data has already been normalized into that one table.  It has two columns that serve as dimensions- time of auction end and product type.  There are a number of measures, including # of items sold and sell price.  After I set up the cube and dimensions in SSAS and process it works fine, and I am able to browse the cube.  I can browse the cube from SAS or from a SSRS report I've made.</p>\n\n<p>However, if I come back on a later day I cannot update the cube anymore.  The table's schema supporting the cube has not changed, though there are new rows.  When I 'process cube' within SSAS, I get this error: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Errors in the OLAP storage engine: The attribute key cannot be found: Table: dbo_ScrapedAuction, Column: Id, Value: 76878. Errors in the OLAP storage engine: The record was skipped because the attribute key was not found.

Does anyone have any ideas what issue I'm running into?  I work around this by recreating the cube... which is not a real solution for production systems.</p>",

    "body": "<p>I really hope someone has a clue on this layout issue, because I am already out of ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Although I think that my problem has something to do with the designs i.e. with way Jasper treats them (layout), here's some general information abou the application.</p>\n\n<p>Basically we have a JAVA client-server application and we use Jasper to generate a bunch of reports. The Jasper designs are processed by a servlet on the server-side and sent to the client as jrprint files, where they are being presented to the user. We also have a scriptlet that does some stuff - concatenating data etc.</p>\n\n<p>The report that I am having trouble with has the following structure shown in code snippet #1</p>\n\n<p>The data for it comes from a SQL query that works perfectly, so it's only the layout that is bugging me.</p>\n\n<p>In the detail I have a bunch of textfields that visualise some hierarchy and another textfield that can contain relatively large amount of text. I've packed each of them in a frame, both of them building up another frame.</p>\n\n<p>Beneath them I have another frame which can contain 0,1 or 2 images (ideally). I end up with a report containing pages like the one in attachment 1.</p>\n\n<p>My goal is to have report pages where there is no space between the above frame and the image frame - like the one in attachment 2, and of course with the text within the upper frame. At the moment this is only possible if I get rid of the lengthy text.</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the problem lies in the definition of the field for the lengthy text. As I don't know how long the string would be, i define it with a height of 13 (code snippet #2 ), that is one line only. Because of the stretching properties of the fields it accommodates accordingly, but by doing so it pushes the images down by variable number of lines. So, is there any way to avoid that \"pushing\", which ruins the design.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Code:</h3>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;band height=\"245\" isSplitAllowed=\"false\"&gt;&lt;!-- 245 --&gt;\n

Checking the interop DLL into VSS isn't desirable, as you then have to check it out whenever you build. Moving the interop DLL to another location to reference directly doesn't work as I need to strong name my assemblies, which requires the original OCX in this case. The interop reference doesn't even show up on the Property Pages > References page. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How do I get it to properly autoupdate? How can I fashion an appropriate .refresh file?</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have plain text files that contain licenses for the other managed DLL references. I created .refresh files that seem to work for both VS2008 and VSS, but weren't created for me automatically. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How should I be including the references in a way that works with VSS?</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Checking in the license files in the bin directory leads to the same problem of having to check them out on every build.</p>",

I think I tried going to 1.1 as well, and had the same problem, but not 100% sure.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I'm on 1.1-beta3 and have implemented a file upload/attachment system as outlined herer: <code>thegioraproject.com/2008/03/26/image-attachments-in-grails-using-imagemagick/</code></p>\n\n<p>I've got a 'broker' object which has a 'logo' (defined as an Image domain).  The Image and Attachment (parent class) are done as defined in the above URL.</p>\n\n<p>In the brokerController, I've got code like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    def file = new Image()\n    def f = params.logo\n    if(f.size&gt;0) {\n        file.setFile(f)\n        file?.save(flush:true)\n        brokerUserInstance.logo?.delete()\n        brokerUserInstance.logo = file\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The 'logo' is the name of the uploaded file from the form.  After this code there's more standard grails CRUD code (<code>brokerUserInstance.properties=params</code>, <code>brokerUserInstance.save()</code>, etc).  </p>\n\n<p>This works fine in 1.1-beta3.  I can upload an image, it'll get thumbnailed and attached to the domain just fine (relations are in place in the db, etc).  When I update the broker object without uploading a new image, the old one it kept intact.</p>\n\n<p>Moving to grails 1.1.1, when I try to upload a new image, I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Error 500: org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessApiUsageException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: Image; nested exception is org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - save the transient instance before flushing: Image\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>and if I don't upload an image, I get:</p>\n\n<pre><code>[org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartFile] to required type [Image] for property logo; nested exception is java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cannot convert value of type [org.springframework.web.multipart.commons.CommonsMultipartFile] to required type [Image] for property logo: no matching editors or conversion strategy found\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm able to find pretty much 0 on this issue.  Works fine in 1.1-beta3, but something's changed (dramatically) in 1.1.1 (and probably 1.1 as well).</p>\n\n<p>Any suggestions/ideas/help?  I'm happy to grant server access to someone to help debug this.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks  :)</p>",

The following scenario occurs on my development system, which for now is also my test system.</p>\n\n<p>When I link A and B against the debug version of the runtime library, A launches happily but then fails to launch B because the system's loader cannot find the debug version of the runtime library.</p>\n\n<p>I have a theory about why this is so: The debugger has somehow put the debug version of the runtime library into the DLL search path in a way that doesn't propagate into A, so when the loader attempts to resolve B's imports, the debug version of the runtime library cannot be found.</p>\n\n<p>What is the best way to overcome this? Finding the file which contains the debug version of the runtime library and adding its parent directory to the DLL search path seems like the most straightforward approach, but I can't help but wonder why the debugger hasn't done this for me. Perhaps it has a good reason which I should not attempt to second-guess.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the right way to go, how can I avoid hard-coding the full pathname to the relevant directory?</p>\n\n<p>Ideas?</p>",

This behavior causes us many problems, since the proxy discards the whole http conversation, when it gets \"100 continue\".\nI googled this issue, and I found that there was a bug in windows server 2003 SP1, which was supposed to be fixed in SP2, but after I installed it, the problem still remains.\nDoes anyone knows how to fix it, or to configure http.sys or remoting not to send the \"100 continue\"?</p>",

    "title": "Empty response during ajax request in Chrome but not IE nor FF",
    "body": "<p>I am receiving an empty response when calling a web method using asp.net in Chrome but not IE nor FF.  I get this behavior using the ASP PageMethod.func as well as using jquery ajax call. </p>\n\n<p>I can 'fix' the symptom by adding a delay sleep call on the server which makes me believe code is just plain wrong somewhere.  I have the <code>webkit</code> fix so that Chrome is using <code>webkit</code> (see the first line of the log).</p>\n\n<p>I have created a simple test case.

    "body": "<p>I have developed a web application that I want to stress test. The app uses a Flash SWF to allow users to browse for images on their machine and upload them to the webserver. This SWF will read jpg images from the local file system, resize them and generate a thumbnail and then upload these as byteArray to an AMFPHP script that writes the byte arrays as .jpg files to the <code>webserver</code> records the image in the database and then sends the image to Amazon S3 for storage.</p>\n\n<p>I have been trying to stress test this using WAS which works well because it records the header information sent and therefore the byte array so I can simulate multiple users - though all uploading the same images! :).</p>\n\n<p>I am finding though that not all images are making it to S3 and not all images are being added to the database. I suspect that this due to the script needing more time than WAS allows in the delay field so my question is - </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to tell WAS to wait for a script to finish executing before moving on rather than sticking to the delay I have specified in the WAS interface? I am thinking that the AMFPHP script that receives the byte array and writes the file is not finishing before the \nimage is being added to the database or sent to S3.</p>\n\n<p>If I could force WAS to wait until it knows a script has completed I could see more clearly where any bottlenecks are. I am simulating about 100 clients (10 threads * 10 sockets) so presumably, this is placing a greater load on this step than can be handled! </p>\n\n<p>Is this a more a case of the testing tool will not accurately simulate the real scenario as in reality Flash would wait to get a success response from AMFPHP that the image has been written before calling the script that creates a record in the database and sends the file to S3? Should I even combine these scripts into a single script so that this is not an issue?</p>\n\n<p>Any advice on this welcome. Our webserver is a Windows 2003 IIS 6 machine.</p>",

This is not normally a problem as I have a Flash menu creator program that makes static SWF files. However, this new one only makes dynamic SWFs (ones that rely on external files and XML). I've tried making a Projector of the file but with the same result: it still needs the external files. After much searching on Google, I have come across Adobe Flex. I have managed to import the main menu SWF file onto the stage using this code:</p>\n\n<p><code>&lt;mx:SWFLoader id=\"loader1\" source=\"menu.swf\" scaleContent=\"false\" autoLoad=\"true\" width=\"183\" height=\"440\" alpha=\"1.0\" left=\"0\" top=\"0\"/&gt;</code></p>\n\n<p>Also, I have referenced the folder of the source files (XML file, PNGs and other icon SWFs) and the menu shows up wonderfully in Flex itself. However, if I publish it as an SWF I end up with the same problem. It won't play on its own, without the dependent files. Could anyone take me through the code, step by step as to how to make an independent SWF file with a transparent background, please? </p>\n\n<p>I can always provide more details if necessary. Please bear in mind that I'm almost a complete coding newbie. I'm really tearing my hair out here!

Is there any tweaking of the XML, or does iterating with an XML Data Reader yield better performance? <br /> If you know of a different approach please provide some code examples if you could.</p>\n\n<p><b>Here is the VB.Net code:</b></p>\n\n<pre><code>        Dim dt As New DataTable(\"Users\")\n        dt.ReadXmlSchema(m_TheSchemaPath)\n        dt.ReadXml(m_datasetstream)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><b>The XML schema:</b></p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;?xml version=\"1.0\" standalone=\"yes\" ?&gt;

    "body": "<p>Here's my problem:  We have N applications running in M different environments (qa/prod/etc.) with P servers per environment.  Multiplied out, the number of unique configurations is in the hundreds.  Each of these applications has a set of environment-specific properties (public hostname, listening port, max memory, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>Multiplied out, there are thousands of properties to set.  However, the actual rules that define what the properties ought to be are significantly simpler.  For example, in production environments with two app instances per physical server, one app binds to port 8080 and the other to 8081.</p>\n\n<p>Here's what I want:  A language (DSL) with which I can specify the rules that dictate what the property settings ought to be.  I'd like to avoid repeating myself.  The language ought to be declarative.  We're pretty Java-centric, but all I need do do is produce name/value pairs, so I'd hate to limit myself.</p>\n\n<p>Does such a thing exist?  I have found nothing.</p>\n\n<p>I suppose I could use Drools or another rules engine, but that's awfully heavy for this purpose.  Property files are the lowest common denominator.  We can put them into war/ear files, use them to do template-based replacements during builds, etc.  There are certainly more elegant ways to solve problems of this nature, but we're kind of stuck with our architectures, at least in the short term.</p>",

The odd-behaviour is that when I go to close a new image via <code>CloseMultiBitmap()</code> the method appears to work, but it only leaves FICACHE and FISPOOL files, not the final image. If I set <code>UseShellExecute = true</code> everything works as expected. </p>\n\n<p>The backgroundworker process calls ImageMagick's convert.exe commandline program. However, it happens if I run any command. It really appears to be due to the UseShellExecute property. I guarantee I am not working on the same image from different threads.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the program loads multi-paged tiff files for splitting and merging operations. When I load the tiffs, each page is extracted from the original and saved in a temp folder. Then I use the backgroundworker to generate preview images for each page.  This takes around half a second per page, so a 60 page tif can take some time to load. While loading the preview images, you can do merging and splitting. I only operate on the original image at this time.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone shed some light on UseShellExecute? I'd like to be able to read StandardError. I just don't see how this property can effect code running on a separate thread.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time.</p>",

Is it possibly not the singleton doing it (thought it seems like it started right when I added the singleton, there were some other app changes in there as well between runs, I think)?

    "body": "<p>I've ported my GWT app to 1.7.0 from 1.5.2 and widgets that are used as a control on a GoogleMap no longer get ClickEvents. I've checked that the DOM insertion of the control is the same and there are no differences there. Since GWT 1.6 introduced a significant change in the way events are handled I'm thinking something has gone amis there.</p>\n\n<p>I use a GWT image as a a GoogleMaps control:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  Image control = new Image(\"/oeg/images/info_32.png\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which I place on the map using the Mapitz GMaps lib (yes I know its old, but I have kept supporting a working version that is updated - if anyone is interested just ask) </p>\n\n<pre><code> GControlPosition infoPosition = \n      new GControlPosition(GControlAnchor.G_ANCHOR_TOP_RIGHT(),\n                           new GSize(7, 30)); \n  getGmap().addControl(new GControl(control, infoPosition)); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've checked the compiled code and it literally just puts the html element on the map as a GControl just the way you'd expect and as I said I've checked the DOM to make sure nothing looks funny. </p>\n\n<p>to get ClickEvents I used to do this... </p>\n\n<pre><code>  control.addClickListener(new ClickListener() { \n        public void onClick(Widget sender) \n        { \n            doTipOfTheDay(); \n        } \n    }); \n</code></pre>\n\n<p>which I changed to this in the 1.6.0 world, </p>\n\n<pre><code>  control.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() { \n        public void onClick(ClickEvent ce) \n        { \n            doTipOfTheDay(); \n        } \n    });\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I've also tried explicitly sinking the click event with</p>\n\n<pre><code>   control.sinkEvents(Event.ONCLICK);\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but none of this works in GWT-1.6.0/1.7.0 and it all worked fabulously in 1.5.2</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone shed some light on this? Has anyone else run into event issues w/ controls on GMaps with GWT 1.6 and above? </p>\n\n<p>FYI with other Gmaps objects I have no problems.  I'm getting mouse clicks on the map surface, on markers etc. </p>\n\n<p>but controls, not so much</p>",

You need to read out the datatable and create/open the excel workbook.</p>\n\n<p>I wish there is a way to directly convert datatable used in winforms to excel fast.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

This solution also contains a SPEventReceivers that has overridden ItemAdded, ItemUpdated, and ItemDeleting.

My .NET webservice returns a string which is parsed from a dataset via the command DataSet.GetXML method.</p>\n\n<pre><code>Function MyFunc() as String\n  'Populate the dataset here\n  '.......\n  Return DataSet.GetXML()\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>In my flex application, I am converting the string value returned by the webservice into an XML:</p>\n\n<pre><code>private var _xmlMyData:XML;\n\nprivate function myResultHandler(event:ResultEvent) :void\n{\n  _xmlMyData = XML(event.result);\n  // This script to view the XML data in Text Area\n  var strData:String = String(event.result);\n  taData.text = strData;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Which I am then passing to my xmlListCollection control</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:XMLListCollection id=\"xmllc_myData\" source=\"{_xmlMyData.Table}\" /&gt;\n&lt;mx:TextArea id=\"taData\" width=\"300\" height=\"100\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Then binding to my tree control:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;mx:Tree id=\"treeOffshore\" dataProvider=\"{xmllc_myData}\" labelField=\"DESCN\" showRoot=\"false\"&gt;\n&lt;/mx:Tree&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When viewing the data in the text area control, I have the following:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;NewDataSet&gt;\n  &lt;Table&gt;\n    &lt;CODE&gt;A1&lt;/CODE&gt;\n    &lt;DESC&gt;Area One&lt;/DESC&gt;\n  &lt;/Table&gt;\n\n  &lt;Table&gt;    \n    &lt;CODE&gt;B2&lt;/CODE&gt;\n    &lt;DESC&gt;Base Two&lt;/DESC&gt;\n  &lt;/Table&gt;\n\n  &lt;Table&gt;\n    &lt;CODE&gt;C4&lt;/CODE&gt;\n    &lt;DESC&gt;Class Four&lt;/DESC&gt;\n  &lt;/Table&gt;\n\n  &lt;Table&gt;\n    &lt;CODE&gt;D8&lt;/CODE&gt;\n    &lt;DESC&gt;Demo Eight&lt;/DESC&gt;\n  &lt;/Table&gt;\n&lt;/NewDataSet&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This is how the treeview renders:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Area One\n  A1\n  Area One\nBase Two\n  B2\n  Base Two\nClass Four\n  C4\n  Class Four\nDemo Eight\n  D8\n  Demo Eight\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>What I want is to be able to define the Description only at the first level only:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Area One\nBase Two\nClass Four\nDemo Eight\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The next thing that I need to accomplish is that the second level of the treeview should actually be populated based on the CODE from the first level.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Area One\n  Sub Item Area One\n  Sub Item Area Two\nBase Two\n  Sub Item Base Two\n  Sub Item Base Three\n  Sub Item Base Four\nClass Four\n  Sub Item Class Four\nDemo Eight\n  Sub Item Demo Eight\n  Sub Item Demo Nine\n  Sub Item Demo Ten\n  Sub Item Demo Eleven\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I am quite new in this tree control thing (as well as flex) and have limited grasp of the concepts to be able to accomplish this.</p>\n\n<p>I am thinking either of modifying the XML data which I originally retrieve and probably insert the sub items per each node, although I am in a bind of how to accomplish the same.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, to give some of you further details, the treeview data would actually be coming from three tables where the table 1 is the base table, and the table 2 contains the children of table 1 and table 3 contains children data from table 3.</p>\n\n<p>I would sincerely appreciate your inputs on this.  I am foraying into the world of Flex and this is quite a make or break scenario towards embracing this technology in our organization.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks and hoping to get some good advice on how to accomplish this.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>",

Outlook asks if I want to save, I choose No. </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that this should reset all changes I made. But if I re-open that same contact all my changes are still there. If I close the whole outlook it will re-prompt me to save the contact I changed. </p>\n\n<p>This leads me to thinking that the default Form Region template actually keeps a reference to the Contact it is being shown for and not disposing of it after the form region is closed. This causes the contact to be in memory and not simply disposed after closing the form.</p>\n\n<p>Can anyone reproduce, or is it a feature? Any way to get around this?</p>",

    "body": "<p>I'm running a VirtualPC 2007 VM with Windows2003 as the OS.  Inside of this I am using a web based VPN to connect to my client's network.  I cannot use this VPN from my host machine because it does not work with Vista (still!).  Inside the VM I'm connecting to a Terminal Server at the client site which I'm logging into using their domain.</p>\n\n<p>I need to change my password.  Obviously what you would normally do is hit ctrl-alt-del and click change password.  However since I'm inside of a TS inside of a VM this is not an option.  When logging in to the VM I have to press alt-(left arrow)-del and then type in my password.  I also know that usually when using remote desktop, in order to simulate a ctrl-alt-del inside there you would press ctrl-alt-end.  With this knowledge, I've tried every possible combination of these keys that I can think of, but none of them bring up the Windows Security Dialog Box.</p>\n\n<p>What I'm looking for is either</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A way to open the Windows Security Dialog Box (or simply the change password form from there) without pressing ctrl-alt-del (is there a command line I can use?)</li>\n<li>A different way to change my domain password without using the aforementioned box</li>\n</ol>",

The problem is, I need to take the directory where the images exist from the MasterView CollectionView, and the individual filenames from the DetailView CollectionView. So I defined the resources:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;CollectionViewSource x:Key=\"MasterView\" /&gt;\n&lt;CollectionViewSource Source=\"{Binding Source={StaticResource MasterView}, Path='tblGallery_tblPictures'}\" x:Key=\"DetailView\" /&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>This seems to work without a problem, I can navigate through the data set and see the Master and Detail data.</p>\n\n<p>To get the full image path, I figured out that I needed a multibinding to put the two together, and have sucessfully created one:</p>\n\n<pre><code> &lt;ListBox HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\"\n    VerticalAlignment=\"Stretch\"\n    ItemsSource=\"{Binding Source={StaticResource DetailView}}\"&gt;\n    &lt;ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n       &lt;DataTemplate&gt;\n         &lt;Image Width=\"120\"\n            Stretch=\"Uniform\"\n            Margin=\"8,8,8,8\"&gt;\n            &lt;Image.Source&gt;\n              &lt;BitmapImage DecodePixelWidth=\"120\"&gt;\n                &lt;BitmapImage.UriSource&gt;\n                  &lt;MultiBinding Converter=\"{StaticResource imagePathConverter}\"&gt;\n                    &lt;Binding Source=\"{StaticResource MasterView}\" Path=\"galleryLocation\" /&gt;\n                    &lt;Binding Path=\"pictureFileName\" /&gt;\n                  &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;\n                 &lt;/BitmapImage.UriSource&gt;\n                &lt;/BitmapImage&gt;\n               &lt;/Image.Source&gt;\n             &lt;/Image&gt;                        \n          &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\n       &lt;/ListBox.ItemTemplate&gt;\n     &lt;ListBox.ItemsPanel&gt;\n\n     &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;\n        &lt;WrapPanel Orientation=\"Horizontal\" HorizontalAlignment=\"Stretch\" /&gt;\n     &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;\n   &lt;/ListBox.ItemsPanel&gt;\n &lt;/ListBox&gt;\n\n Public Function Convert(ByVal values() As Object, ByVal targetType As System.Type, ByVal parameter As Object, ByVal culture As System.Globalization.CultureInfo) As Object Implements System.Windows.Data.IMultiValueConverter.Convert\n\n    If values.Count() &lt;&gt; 2 Then\n        Throw New InvalidOperationException(\"Correct Values Not Provided\")\n    End If\n\n    Dim directory As String\n    Dim fileName As String\n    Dim imgUri As Uri = Nothing\n\n    If TypeOf values(0) Is String And TypeOf values(1) Is String Then\n        directory = CType(values(0), String)\n        fileName = CType(values(1), String)\n\n        If directory &lt;&gt; \"\" And fileName &lt;&gt; \"\" Then\n            If directory.LastIndexOf(\"/\") = directory.Length - 1 Then\n                imgUri = New Uri(directory &amp; fileName, UriKind.Absolute)\n            Else\n                imgUri = New Uri(directory &amp; \"/\" &amp; fileName, UriKind.Absolute)\n            End If\n\n        End If\n    End If\n\n    Return (imgUri)\n\nEnd Function\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My assumption with the proceeding code, is that the MultiBinding that is inside the DataTemplate has access to the BindingSource that is defined as the\nItemsSource from the listbox. However when I look into the MultiValueConverter code it only passes the data from the MasterView and a generic object for the second value.</p>\n\n<p>To see if I could get it to work, I added the detail source information in the multibinding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;MultiBinding Converter=\"{StaticResource imagePathConverter}\"&gt;\n  &lt;Binding Source=\"{StaticResource MasterView}\" Path=\"galleryLocation\" /&gt;\n  &lt;Binding Source=\"{StaticResource DetailView}\" Path=\"pictureFileName\" /&gt;\n&lt;/MultiBinding&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That at least enabled me to see that there were 5 pictures in the listbox, but they were all the same picture. It seems that the multibinding access to the DetailView CollectionView only showed the first item. </p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to link the \"pictureFileName\" to the current ItemsSource item so that the right picture can be displayed?</p>\n\n<p>thanks!</p>\n\n<p>Josh</p>",

When I load up the unit test DLL in Depends.exe (Dependency Walker), Depends.exe will complain that it can't find msvcr90d.dll, which is the VS2008 debug C runtime. I copied that file to the Out folder for the test run and tried running mstest on the test DLL but it didn't fix the problem.

    "body": "<p>I've managed to discover <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/gillesk/archive/2009/03/23/playing-back-wave-files-in-silverlight.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gilles Khouzam's playback implementation</a> for WAV files in Silverlight 3 and while that would be the majority of the battle, I'm stuck on a final detail: how do I pull a wav file from the web some place and then feed it into his WaveMediaStreamSource for playback?</p>\n\n<p>Here's the closest I've come:</p>\n\n<pre><code>    public MainControl()\n    {\n        // Required to initialize variables\n        InitializeComponent();\n        PlayButton.Click += PlayButtonClicked;\n    }\n\n    private void PlayButtonClicked(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\n    {\n        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest) WebRequest.Create(@\"soundfile.wav\");\n        request.BeginGetResponse(ReadCallback, request); \n    }\n\n    private void ReadCallback(IAsyncResult asynchronousResult)\n    {\n        HttpWebRequest request = (HttpWebRequest)asynchronousResult.AsyncState;\n        HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.EndGetResponse(asynchronousResult);\n\n        WaveMediaStreamSource wavMss = new WaveMediaStreamSource(response.GetResponseStream());\n        MediaPlayer.SetSource(wavMss);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong>\nIt turns out the problem had to do with HttpWebRequest. Changing the code to:</p>\n\n<pre><code>        public MainPage()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        WebClient webClient = new WebClient();\n        webClient.OpenReadCompleted += new OpenReadCompletedEventHandler(webClient_OpenReadCompleted);\n        webClient.OpenReadAsync(new Uri(@\"http://www.russellmyers.com/somefile.wav\", UriKind.Absolute));\n    }\n\n    void webClient_OpenReadCompleted(object sender, OpenReadCompletedEventArgs e)\n    {\n\n\n        WaveMediaStreamSource wavMss = new WaveMediaStreamSource(e.Result);\n        Debug.WriteLine(\"Setting source...\");\n        Media.SetSource(wavMss);\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Works fine. This makes sense too after reading <a href=\"http://wildermuth.com/2008/09/27/WebClient_vs_WebRequest_in_Silverlight_2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shawn Wildermuth's article on the differences</a>. I would like to get HttpWebRequest working though because it won't be done on the UI thread.</p>",

    "body": "<p>I want to add a little flair to my application and while I have been somewhat successful, I haven't figured out a way to truly do what I want to do. I would try to subclass UITabViewController, but I don't think I would even know where to start or if that is the right approach. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, what I want to do is have custom images for each tab bar button. I have both pressed and non-pressed images. Instead of using the highlight that is generated over the current icon, I want the pressed image to be shown. What I've been able to do is create a Category of the UITabBar with a custom drawRect method that basically draws all of my custom tab bar icons. I then initialize the same amount of UITabBarItems w/out specifying an image or title of any kind which I then add to the array of items. This lets me have my icons and then just overlays the highlight on them. </p>\n\n<p>This is ok I guess, but I would really like to have the pressed button look. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the code I use for drawing the tab bar:</p>\n\n<pre><code>@implementation UITabBar (CustomImage)\n\n\n-(void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect\n{\n    UIImage *image = [UIImage imageNamed:@\"TabBar.png\"];\n    [image drawInRect:CGRectMake(0,0,320,50)];\n}\n\n@end\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>And then I initialize the tab bar items like this:</p>\n\n<pre><code>UITabBarItem *homeTabBarItem = [[UITabBarItem alloc] init];\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If anyone knows how I would do this, that would be greatly appreciated. Please keep in mind that I'm still relatively new to Objective-C, so I'm somewhat confused as to how I would correctly subclass anything at this point. </p>\n\n<p>The functionality I'm looking for would be similar to what RougeSheep was able to accomplish with Postage: <a href=\"http://postage.roguesheep.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://postage.roguesheep.com/</a> They did an awesome job, and this is kind of what I'd like to emulate. </p>",

    "title": "Model for Resource Allocation",
    "body": "<p>I'm working on a time management project and looking for some practical object/persistence models. Fowler has some great ideas on resource allocation in his Analysis Patterns book, but many are overkill for what I need right now, and by design, highly conceptual (as opposed to implementable)</p>\n\n<p>The focal conceptual object I'm thinking of would be an Allocation object, which looks something like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Allocation: Entity\n-------------\nId : Id\nResourceId : Id\nAtivityId : Id\nEventDate ; DateTime\nTimeSpent : TimeQuantity\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm also thinking this would be a database table, although I'm not sure if it would be an associative table between Resources and Activities, or a stand-alone lookup table (with the domain enforcing referential integrity).</p>\n\n<p>The other two conceptual objects would be the Resource and the Activity. Both would have a set of Allocations, but after that, I'm a bit stuck in thinking out the interfaces. Different types of StaffMembers and Consultants are Resources of interest. The primary interest of an Activity would be based on a Project, with NonProject activities based on various payroll Accounts.</p>\n\n<p>This is a C# project using NHibernate.</p>\n\n<p>I realize this is a broad question, and not really a question about programming per se. If anyone knows of a more appropriate forum to discuss this, that would be great. If you also have some experience with this domain and have some ideas or links you are willing to share, that would be fantastic!</p>\n\n<h1>RESPONSE TO ORBMAN</h1>\n\n<p>Good questions:  </p>\n\n<p>1) Whose time is tracked (Resources), which can be<br>\n    - FullTimeStaff<br>\n    - AdminStaff<br>\n    - Consultants  </p>\n\n<p>2) Recording period is weekly<br>\n    - User can enter and revise time spent at any time prior to posting<br>\n    - Timesheets must be posted for department manager review every week (Sunday)\n        (System will not let the user post unless weekly quotas are met)<br>\n    - A manager has until the following Tuesday to approve/reject   </p>\n\n<p>3) Time must be allocated to Activities, which are two basic types<br>\n    - Project based activities<br>\n    - Non-project activities (which winds up posted to various P/R accounts)  </p>\n\n<p>4) reports by either a Resource or an Activity s/b available over ad hoc time periods.  </p>\n\n<p>The main problem I hit centers around the polymorphism needed for both Resource and Activity and how it should be persisted. In the domain it's more useful to have an IResource or <code>IActivity</code>, both of which implement <code>IAllocatable</code>: </p>\n\n<pre><code>UniqueId : Id\nBusinessId : string\nDescription : string\nAllocations : ISet\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The constraint that a Resource can only allocate time to an Activity is what makes them different (Activity needs a ClockIn method and Resource does not). Both need to be wrappers for well known objects that serve other purposes in the system (ie, StaffMember, Project).</p>\n\n<p>I need a unique id for persistence and maybe a surrogate key for the allocation itself. I'm also not sure if there must be referential integrity between the allocations and the wrapped resources / activities and how to map that if so. I have been using Fluent NHibernate but I think it might wind up being easier to just use NHibernate.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks again for the good questions.</p>",

However Silverlight doesn't support that, and I found out that they recommend to use a custom binding instead.</p>\n\n<p>I'd like to know wether I need to configure the binding in a special way regarding security. My distributed application works well when the client and the server are running in the same machine but not when running in different ones. In this case I get the following error:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The message with action\n  '<a href=\"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/rm/CreateSequence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/02/rm/CreateSequence</a>'\n  cannot be processed at the receiver,\n  due to a ContractFilter mismatch at\n  the EndpointDispatcher. This may be\n  because of either a contract mismatch\n  (mismatched Actions betwwen sender and\n  receiver) or a binding/security\n  mismatch between the sender and the\n  revceiver. Check that sender and\n  receiver have the same contract and\n  the same binding (including security\n  requirements, e.g. Message, Transport,\n  None).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have already checked the contract and the binding (the problem arises when switching to custom binding while it works ok with netTcpBinding).

    "body": "<p>I have a web service in .NET 1.1 and WSE 2.0 that uses WS-Security with x509 certificates for both signature and encryption.  I'm trying to configure a WCF client to connect with this service, and it's proving more challenging than I had expected.</p>\n\n<p>I've gotten past most of my versioning issues by using a custom binding, but I'm stuck on one last point.  The web service includes two BinarySecurityToken elements in the response SOAP envelope -- one for the encrypting certificate, one for the signing certificate.</p>\n\n<p>The problem seems to be that WCF is choking on the second token.  This is the error message:</p>\n\n<p>\"Cannot find a token authenticator for the 'System.IdentityModel.Tokens.X509SecurityToken' token type. Tokens of that type cannot be accepted according to current security settings.\"</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/wcf/thread/520a2f77-bf7f-4662-9647-6e5237da8ab5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this conversation on MSDN</a> which describes the exact problem I'm having; but unfortunately, it doesn't provide a good resolution.  Creating a message encoder to hack the envelope into something WCF can handle seems wrong to me.  WSE 2.0 could handle inline security tokens fine -- there must be a way to force WCF to do the same.</p>\n\n<p>While I do have the complete source for the original WSE 2.0 service, changing the way it handles security isn't an option at this point.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the security binding element I'm currently using:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Dim lSBE As New System.ServiceModel.Channels.AsymmetricSecurityBindingElement()\n\nDim lInitiatorTokenParameters As New System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.X509SecurityTokenParameters\nlInitiatorTokenParameters.InclusionMode = System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.SecurityTokenInclusionMode.AlwaysToRecipient\nlInitiatorTokenParameters.X509ReferenceStyle = System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.X509KeyIdentifierClauseType.RawDataKeyIdentifier\nlInitiatorTokenParameters.RequireDerivedKeys = False\nlSBE.InitiatorTokenParameters = lInitiatorTokenParameters\n\nDim lRecipientTokenParameters As New System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.X509SecurityTokenParameters\nlRecipientTokenParameters.InclusionMode = System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.SecurityTokenInclusionMode.AlwaysToRecipient\nlRecipientTokenParameters.X509ReferenceStyle = System.ServiceModel.Security.Tokens.X509KeyIdentifierClauseType.RawDataKeyIdentifier\nlRecipientTokenParameters.RequireDerivedKeys = False\nlSBE.RecipientTokenParameters = lRecipientTokenParameters\n\nlSBE.MessageSecurityVersion = MessageSecurityVersion.WSSecurity10WSTrustFebruary2005WSSecureConversationFebruary2005WSSecurityPolicy11BasicSecurityProfile10\nlSBE.DefaultAlgorithmSuite = System.ServiceModel.Security.SecurityAlgorithmSuite.Basic128Rsa15\nlSBE.SetKeyDerivation(False)\nlSBE.IncludeTimestamp = True\nlSBE.AllowSerializedSigningTokenOnReply = True\nlSBE.MessageProtectionOrder = System.ServiceModel.Security.MessageProtectionOrder.SignBeforeEncrypt\n</code></pre>",

    "body": "<p>I'm working on a WPF application that displays a number of graphical elements (RectangleGeometries and Splines) that are animated in sync with video displayed in a MediaElement.</p>\n\n<p>The synchronization tree is constructed as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Storyboard</strong> (for control: Begin(), Pause(), Seek() ...)\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>MediaTimeline</strong> (connected to the MediaElement using Storyboard.SetTargetName())</li>\n<li><strong>ParallelTimeline</strong>0 (subdivided in ParallelTimelines to ease object management)\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>KeyframeAnimation</strong>0 (animates some graphical element)</li>\n<li><strong>KeyframeAnimation</strong>1 (animates some other graphical element)</li>\n<li>...</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>... (possible more ParallelTimelines...)</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Due to the dynamic nature of the elements being displayed and animated, all of this is constructed and managed in code, i.e., no XAML. Setting this up and playing, seeking, etc., works perfectly fine.</p>\n\n<p>The problem I'm facing, however, is the following.</p>\n\n<p>The animated elements can be updated (e.g., Animation KeyFrames are updated, added, removed, ...) from time to time, while the video is still being shown, albeit likely in paused state. Simply updating the original animations has no effect since frozen copies (Freezable) of all animations are apparently used during Storyboard playback (looking at the source code, this freezing seems to occur in the Begin() method when clocks are allocated and animations are applied to Dependency Properties). I've tried making my animations unfreezable (CanFreeze == false), but this just causes exceptions without playing anything.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to update only some animations (e.g., only <strong>ParallelTimeline</strong>0 and children) without forcing the entire Storyboard to be reset and without breaking synchronization with the original MediaTimeline or forcing the MediaTimeline to reload (which involves reloading and re-seeking the associated media and causing significant delay)?</p>",

The DLL has a private bin path specified so that code in <code>MyAppExecs</code> is reachable.</p>\n\n<p>So on startup, I load a <code>Starter.DLL</code> in the <code>MyAppExecs</code> folder which should popup a dialog, which it does. However clicking on a button on the dialog, needs to load <code>X.DLL</code>, which has unmanaged dependencies. (<code>X.DLL</code> has some managed C++, has some libs specified as additional dependencies. X is unsigned and a private assembly, not in GAC)</p>\n\n<p>X.DLL, however, cannot be resolved. From the <code>fuslogvw</code> tool, I see that it is attempting to <strong>load this DLL in the Office12 folder and failing</strong>. I have <code>ProcMon</code> running too, however, it doesn't show any unmanaged dependency file not found errors. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>How do I make the Word Executable see the X.Dll which is present in <code>D: \\Work\\Seven\\WordAutomation\\ContentControls\\WordDocument1\\bin\\Debug</code>?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also, it seems strange that it can load <code>Starter.DLL</code> and a ton of others without any problems in the <code>{ProjFolder}\\MyAppExecs</code> but can't see files in <code>{ProjFolder}</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Here's the <code>fuslogvw</code> output:</p>\n\n<pre><code>*** Assembly Binder Log Entry  (12/9/2008 @ 6:10:06 PM) ***\n\nThe operation failed.\nBind result: hr = 0x80070002.

However, the above assembly resolution error kept being logged and it didn't work. \nFinally, in a fit of desperation, I copied my word-project DLLs into <code>{ProjFolder}\\MyAppExecs</code> such that all the DLLs were in one folder and it started working.</p>\n\n<p>It looks like some unmanaged dependencies of <code>X.dll</code> are not being resolved when I run from the <code>{ProjFolder}...</code> however, <code>ProcMon</code> doesn't show any sign of that. Also updated the PATH variable to include <code>{ProjFolder}\\MyAppExecs</code>, but no luck.</p>\n\n<p>So copying it all into one single folder is what worked. <code>X.dll</code> is not my code so I couldn't probe any further.</p>",

    "title": "How to create a custom GControl",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to create a gray \"frame\" (see pic below) around a google map, to try to convey the concept of an area of focus, as oppose to a point (which is usually represented with a marker). Note that this is not an overlay, that is, the gray \"frame\" should not move when you drag the map. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited: image link added</strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QHbfv.jpg\" alt=\"http://i680.photobucket.com/albums/vv170/bustrofedon_bucket/inage1.jpg\"></p>\n\n<p>It appears that only option is to \"subclass\" GControl to create a custom control. I have 3 questions</p>\n\n<p>1) First of all, is GControl subclassing the best course of action?</p>\n\n<p>2) In my example, the canvas (div) where map renders can change its size (i.e is not fixed width). Do I have to delete and add custom control when canvas changes size? See docs <a href=\"http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/controls.html#Custom_Controls\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/controls.html#Custom_Controls</a> on how to create a custom map control.</p>\n\n<p>3) Now, how to do it. Naively, I thought I could create a table with 3 columns and 3 rows, and set display: none for the cell in the middle. But that doesn't work. I've also experimented with clipping, that didn't work either. My css skills are quite lacking, so there must be way to do this more elegantly than adding four rectangular gray divs. If I wanted to add an inner border, with divs, I would need to paint 8 then. In a nutshell, what's the best way to create a \"hollow\" rectangle?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks\nP.S. This is my first entry to StackOverflow. Just discovered it. It's impressive how well SO is put together.</p>",

I have opened it in Sharepoint designer, but I really don't know how to apply Ajax to it. Any suggestions, pointers towards blogs, demos, etc would be really appreciated. </p>\n\n<p>I'm going to have to add a refresh button so it has a child control to trigger the refresh, which is fine.

Is there now way to tell the model that anything added to the child collection should be added on submit?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>",

This of course is nothing new to anyone who knows some Ruby, but is often forgotten in a chase for new functionality and features. Ramaze only tries to give you the ultimate tools, but you have to use them yourself to achieve perfect custom-tailored results. </p>\n\n<p>Another one of the goals during development of Ramaze was to make every part as modular and therefore reusable as possible, not only to provide a basic understanding after the first glance, but also to make it as simple as possible to reuse parts of the code. </p>\n\n<p>The original purpose of Ramaze was to act as a kind of framework to build web-frameworks, this was made obsolete by the introduction of rack, which provides this feature at a better level without trying to enforce any structural layout of the resulting framework.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic Example</h2>\n\n<pre><code>require 'ramaze'\n\nclass MainController &lt; Ramaze::Controller\n  def index\n    \"Hello, Ramaze!\"\n  end\nend\n\nRamaze.start\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n\n<p>Installing Ramaze is super easy when using Rubygems:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ gem install ramaze\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Once the gem is installed you can create a new application using the \"ramaze\" binary:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$ ramaze create myapp\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2>Links</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Ramaze/ramaze/\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub Repository</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/ramaze\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Groups</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ramaze.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ramaze.net/documentation/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">User Guide</a></li>\n<li><strong>#ramaze</strong> on Freenode</li>\n</ul>",

A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component.\nLogRecord: Used to pass logging requests between the logging framework and individual log handlers.</p>\n\n<p>Handler: Exports LogRecord objects to a variety of destinations including memory, output streams, consoles, files, and sockets. A variety of Handler subclasses exist for this purpose. Additional Handlers may be developed by third parties and delivered on top of the core platform.</p>\n\n<p>Level: Defines a set of standard logging levels that can be used to control logging output. Programs can be configured to output logging for some levels while ignoring output for others.</p>\n\n<p>Filter: Provides fine-grained control over what gets logged, beyond the control provided by log levels. The logging APIs support a general-purpose filter mechanism that allows application code to attach arbitrary filters to control logging output.</p>\n\n<p>Formatter: Provides support for formatting LogRecord objects. This package includes two formatters, SimpleFormatter and XMLFormatter, for formatting log records in plain text or XML respectively.

    "body": "<p>The term \"name collision\" has been used in computer science for more than 3 decades, when referring to names in various classification systems. Most of the time, a name collision must be resolved immediately in some way, whether automatically by an operating system or compiler or manually through user input and decisions. The concept of a namespace sometimes resolves collision issues by creating different logical regions in which items with similar names can co-exist without ambiguity. In certain programming instances, a name collision might not be immediately evident, occasionally leading to hard-to-find program errors that can result from the compiler making certain assumptions about the names of items used.</p>\n\n<p>An example of how a name collision can occur involves two directories full of files. If each directory contains a file named \"DATA\", and the contents of one directory are copied into the other, then the computer's attempts to copy the file named DATA will find that a file with the same name already exists in the target directory. This creates a name collision. In this instance, the user usually will be prompted and allowed to choose from a list of resolutions, including renaming one of the files, not copying the file or overwriting one of the files.</p>\n\n<p>One commonly used solution for a name collision is the implementation of namespaces. A namespace is simply a way to define an area under which object names are contained. In the above example, a directory technically is a namespace, meaning multiple files can all have the same name as long as they are each in different directories.</p>\n\n<p>From a programming perspective, a name collision can occur in situations such as multiple inheritance, overlapping variable scopes, or even with imported libraries in some languages. In general, a compiler will notice a conflict and generate a warning or error, although this might not always be the case. Other than using namespaces, collisions in many programming languages can be avoided by using qualifiers. A qualifier usually is a prefix that can be placed in front of a variable or class name to distinguish it from another variable with the same name.</p>",

    "body": "<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scrimage</a></strong> is a Scala image library for manipulating and processing of images. The aim of the this library is to provide a quick and easy way to do the kinds of image operations that most people need, such as scaling, rotating, converting between formats and applying filters. It is not intended to provide functionality that might be required by a more \"serious\" image application - such as face recognition or movement tracking.</p>\n\n<p>A typical use case for this library would be creating thumbnails of images uploaded by users in a web app, or resizing a set of images to have a consistent size, or optimizing PNG uploads by users to apply maximum compression, or applying a grayscale filter in a print application.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scrimage</a></strong> has a consistent, idiomatic scala, and mostly immutable API that builds on the java.awt.Image methods. I say mostly immutable because for some operations creating a copy of the underlying image would prove expensive (think an in place filter on a 8000 x 6000 image where you do not care about keeping the original in memory). For these kinds of operations <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/sksamuel/scrimage\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scrimage</a></strong> supports a MutableImage instance where operations that can be performed in place mutate the original instead of returning a copy.</p>",

The user writes a function to be minimized as a function of these <code>Parameter</code>s, and the <code>scipy.optimize</code> methods are used to find the optimal values for the <code>Parameter</code>s. The Levenberg-Marquardt (leastsq) is the default minimization algorithm, and provides estimated standard errors and correlations between varied <code>Parameter</code>s. Other minimization methods, including Nelder-Mead\u2019s downhill simplex, Powell\u2019s method, BFGS, Sequential Least Squares, and others are also supported.

We really mean functions here, not object-methods, infinite-server-loops, or any other such construction. This aspect of Webmachine is one of the reasons why Webmachine applications are relatively easy to understand and extend.</p>\n\n<p>These functions give you a place to define the representations and other Web-relevant properties of your application's resources -- with the emphasis that the first-class things on the Web are resources and that their essential properties of interaction are already quite well defined and usefully constrained.</p>\n\n<p>For most Webmachine applications, most of the functions are quite small and isolated. One of the nice effects of this is that a quick reading of a resource will give you an understanding of the application, its Web behavior, and the relationship between them. Since these functions are usually referentially transparent, Webmachine applications can be quite easy to test. There's no need for mock objects, fake database connections, or any other wastes of time when you can write tests against each component of your application in terms of the input and output to various functions.</p>\n\n<p>We believe that by giving Web developers a system with conventions that directly map to HTTP and REST, we help them to write and extend Web applications quickly while not dictating the shape of the rest of their application. The resulting applications are straightforward to examine and maintain, and have very easily understood HTTP semantics.

The BFG, unlike git-filter-branch, does not give you the opportunity to handle\n  a file differently based on where or when it was committed within your\n  history. This constraint gives the core performance benefit of The\n  BFG, and is well-suited to the task of cleansing bad data - you don\u2019t\n  care <em>where</em> the bad data is, you just want it <em>gone</em>.</p></li>\n  <li><p>By default The BFG takes full advantage of multi-core machines, cleansing commit file-trees in parallel. git-filter-branch cleans\n  commits sequentially (ie in a single-threaded manner), though it <em>is</em>\n  possible to write filters that include their own parallellism, in the\n  scripts executed against each commit.</p></li>\n  <li><p>The <a href=\"https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/#examples\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">command options</a> are much\n  more restrictive than git-filter branch, and dedicated just to the\n  tasks of removing unwanted data- e.g: <code>--strip-blobs-bigger-than 1M</code>.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also the <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/tags/git-rewrite-history/info\">git-rewrite-history</a> tag on Stack Overflow.</p>",

That name was given by analogy with \"white light\", which was assumed to have such a \"flat\" power spectrum over the visible range. Other color names, like \"pink\", \"red\", and \"blue\" were then given to noise with other spectral profiles; often (but not always) in reference to the color of light with similar spectra.

    "body": "<p><strong>Hammer is a open-source library that can recognize gestures made by touch, mouse and pointerEvents. It has support for multiple instances the same time, so you can start creating multi-user touch interfaces. Hammer doesn't have any dependencies, and it's small, only 3.7 kB minified + gzipped!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Visit the website: <a href=\"http://hammerjs.github.io/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hammerjs.github.io/</a></p>\n\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n\n<p>It's easy to use, just include the library and create a new instance.\n<code>js\nvar hammertime = new Hammer(element, options);\nhammertime.on('pan', function(ev) {\n    console.log(ev);\n});\n</code></p>\n\n<p>By default it adds a set of <code>tap</code>, <code>doubletap</code>, <code>press</code>, <em>horizontal</em> <code>pan</code> and <code>swipe</code>, and the\nmulti-touch <code>pinch</code> and <code>rotate</code> recognizers. The pinch and rotate recognizers are disabled by default\nbecause they would make the element blocking, but you can enable them by calling\n<code>js\nmc.get('pinch').set({ enable: true });\nmc.get('rotate').set({ enable: true });\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Also the viewport meta tag is recommended, it gives more control back to the webpage by disabling the\ndoubletap/pinch zoom. More recent browsers that support the touch-action property don't require this.\n<code>html\n&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"user-scalable=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1\"&gt;\n</code></p>\n\n<h3>More control</h3>\n\n<p>You can setup your own set of recognizers for your instance. This requires a bit more code, but it gives you more\ncontrol about the gestures that are being recognized.\n<code>js\nvar myOptions = { };\nvar mc = new Hammer.Manager(myElement, myOptions);\n    mc.add(new Hammer.Pan({ direction: Hammer.DIRECTION_ALL, threshold: 0 }));\n    mc.add(new Hammer.Tap({ event: 'quadrupletap', taps: 4 }));\n    mc.on(\"pan\", handlePan);\nmc.on(\"quadrupletap\", handleTaps);\n</code>\nThe example above creates an instance containing a <code>pan</code> and a <code>quadrupletap</code> gesture. The recognizer instances you\ncreate a being executed in the order they are added, and only one can be recognized at the time.</p>\n\n<p>See the pages about the <code>recognizeWith</code> and <code>requireFailure</code> for\nmore details.</p>\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<p>It's recommended to listen to <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/eightmedia/hammerhammerhammer\" rel=\"nofollow\">this loop</a> while using hammer.js.\nFollow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jorikdelaporik\" rel=\"nofollow\">@jorikdelaporik</a> for tweets about this library.</p>\n\n<p>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ppcano\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pepe Cano</a> for his contributions.</p>",

This can come in a variety of ways depending on the device, but the purpose is the same. Root access will give the user the ability to install software outside approved methods. It also allows you direct access to OS files that you would not normally have access to.</p>\n<p>Questions that should have the <code>jailbreak</code> tag would include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>achieving an escalation of privileges or entitlements</li>\n<li>accessing system file locations</li>\n<li>creating 'jailbroken' apps or tweaks to other apps</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the iOS platform is locked from user modification and the confines of the App Store, a need arose to allow users to install apps and change the OS to work around and outside the basic offerings of the OS. While some methods can be reused, Apple generally tries to close any open loopholes that allow this to happen. This creates the cycle of closing the holes and finding new ones to gain root access to the device. In the iPhone's short history, access has always been obtained.</p>\n<p>While jailbreaking your device is generally regarded as being a safe practice, it is not for the faint of heart. Some methods can be very complicated to achieve a proper jailbreak, and others like the <a href=\"http://jailbreakme.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jailbreakme.com</a> exploit can be very easy. It is suggested that before you attempt to jailbreak your device that you back it up and read the proper documentation for your device and OS version.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in jailbreaking your device, you can find a wealth of information on these sites, or by using a simple search.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://redsn0w.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">redsn0w</a> - The most popular unlock tool for iOS some years ago</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://evasi0n.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">evasi0n</a> - iOS 6.0-6.1.2 Untethered JB.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cydia.saurik.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cydia</a> - The jailbreak 'App Store' equivalent</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iOS JB Wiki</a> - Wikipedia page with history, definitions, and general info on jailbreaking</p>\n<p>In 2021, the popular jailbreak tools for iOS include:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://checkra.in/%22checkra1n%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Checkra1n</a> - exploiting the m8 hardware flaw</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://unc0ver.dev\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unc0ver</a> - re-jailbreak conveniently by pressing a button in an app</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://taurine.app\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">taurine</a> - along with chimera and odyssey before it, uses the Sileo store rather than Cydia</p>\n<p>As a disclaimer, jailbreaking will void any warranty you have on your device. If your phone is broken, or bricked as it is referred to, don't expect any help from the Apple Store or Genius Bar. While jailbreaking is almost always reversible with a simple restore in iTunes, it is not 100%. So proceed at your own risk.</p>",

Geppetto is lightweight, weighing in around half a kilobyte minified and gzipped.</p>\n\n<p>The architecture of Geppetto was greatly inspired by the popular Robotlegs framework for Actionscript.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Another Framework?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Backbone has been called an MV* framework, because it's not strictly MVC, MVP, nor any other MV-something. Sure, the Backbone Router can be made to act \"controllery,\" but it's not really a good idea to tie all your business logic to URL change events.</p>\n\n<p>More commonly, in Backbone applications you'll find business logic implemented directly in Backbone.View components, or sometimes in the Model. For smaller apps, it's convenient to declare your \"events\" and your callback functions in the same place. But as applications grow, and business logic needs to be reused across separate view components, this practice starts to get messy.</p>\n\n<p>To solve this issue, Geppetto implements a scalable Controller architecture for Backbone, prescribing an MVC-style separation of concerns. This makes it possible to write code that is loosely-coupled, easy-to-reuse, and highly-testable.</p>",

    "post_id": "30320592",
    "title": "",
    "body": "<p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model { }\n\n$this-&gt;load-&gt;model('post_model', 'post');\n\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;get_all();\n\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;get(1);\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;get_by('title', 'Pigs CAN Fly!');\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;get_many_by('status', 'open');\n\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;insert(array(\n    'status' =&gt; 'open',\n    'title' =&gt; \"I'm too sexy for my shirt\"\n));\n\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;update(1, array( 'status' =&gt; 'closed' ));\n\n$this-&gt;post-&gt;delete(1);\nInstallation/Usage\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Download and drag the MY_Model.php file into your application/core folder. CodeIgniter will load and initialise this class automatically for you.</p>\n\n<p>Extend your model classes from MY_Model and all the functionality will be baked in automatically.</p>\n\n<p>Naming Conventions</p>\n\n<p>This class will try to guess the name of the table to use, by finding the plural of the class name.</p>\n\n<p>For instance:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model { }\n...will guess a table name of posts. It also works with _m:\n\nclass Book_m extends MY_Model { }\n...will guess books.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If you need to set it to something else, you can declare the $_table instance variable and set it to the table name:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model\n{\n    public $_table = 'blogposts';\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Some of the CRUD functions also assume that your primary key ID column is called 'id'. You can overwrite this functionality by setting the $primary_key instance variable:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model\n{\n    public $primary_key = 'post_id';\n}\nCallbacks/Observers\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>There are many times when you'll need to alter your model data before it's inserted or returned. This could be adding timestamps, pulling in relationships or deleting dependent rows. The MVC pattern states that these sorts of operations need to go in the model. In order to facilitate this, MY_Model contains a series of callbacks/observers -- methods that will be called at certain points.</p>\n\n<p>The full list of observers are as follows:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$before_create\n$after_create\n$before_update\n$after_update\n$before_get\n$after_get\n$before_delete\n$after_delete\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>These are instance variables usually defined at the class level. They are arrays of methods on this class to be called at certain points. An example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Book_model extends MY_Model\n{\n    public $before_create = array( 'timestamps' );\n\n    protected function timestamps($book)\n    {\n        $book['created_at'] = $book['updated_at'] = date('Y-m-d H:i:s');\n        return $book;\n    }\n}\nRemember to always always always return the $row object you're passed. Each observer overwrites its predecessor's data, sequentially, in the order the observers are defined.\n\nObservers can also take parameters in their name, much like CodeIgniter's Form Validation library. Parameters are then accessed in $this-&gt;callback_parameters:\n\npublic $before_create = array( 'data_process(name)' );\npublic $before_update = array( 'data_process(date)' );\n\nprotected function data_process($row)\n{\n    $row[$this-&gt;callback_parameters[0]] = $this-&gt;_process($row[$this-&gt;callback_parameters[0]]);\n\n    return $row;\n}\nValidation\n\nMY_Model uses CodeIgniter's built in form validation to validate data on insert.\n\nYou can enable validation by setting the $validate instance to the usual form validation library rules array:\n\nclass User_model extends MY_Model\n{\n    public $validate = array(\n        array( 'field' =&gt; 'email', \n               'label' =&gt; 'email',\n               'rules' =&gt; 'required|valid_email|is_unique[users.email]' ),\n        array( 'field' =&gt; 'password',\n               'label' =&gt; 'password',\n               'rules' =&gt; 'required' ),\n        array( 'field' =&gt; 'password_confirmation',\n               'label' =&gt; 'confirm password',\n               'rules' =&gt; 'required|matches[password]' ),\n    );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Anything valid in the form validation library can be used here. To find out more about the rules array, please view the library's documentation.</p>\n\n<p>With this array set, each call to insert() or update() will validate the data before allowing the query to be run. Unlike the CodeIgniter validation library, this won't validate the POST data, rather, it validates the data passed directly through.</p>\n\n<p>You can skip the validation with skip_validation():</p>\n\n<pre><code>$this-&gt;user_model-&gt;skip_validation();\n$this-&gt;user_model-&gt;insert(array( 'email' =&gt; 'blah' ));\nAlternatively, pass through a TRUE to insert():\n\n$this-&gt;user_model-&gt;insert(array( 'email' =&gt; 'blah' ), TRUE);\nUnder the hood, this calls validate().\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Protected Attributes</p>\n\n<p>If you're lazy like me, you'll be grabbing the data from the form and throwing it straight into the model. While some of the pitfalls of this can be avoided with validation, it's a very dangerous way of entering data; any attribute on the model (any column in the table) could be modified, including the ID.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent this from happening, MY_Model supports protected attributes. These are columns of data that cannot be modified.</p>\n\n<p>You can set protected attributes with the $protected_attributes array:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model\n{\n    public $protected_attributes = array( 'id', 'hash' );\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now, when insert or update is called, the attributes will automatically be removed from the array, and, thus, protected:</p>\n\n<pre><code>$this-&gt;post_model-&gt;insert(array(\n    'id' =&gt; 2,\n    'hash' =&gt; 'aqe3fwrga23fw243fWE',\n    'title' =&gt; 'A new post'\n));\n\n// SQL: INSERT INTO posts (title) VALUES ('A new post')\nRelationships\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>MY_Model now has support for basic belongs_to and has_many relationships. These relationships are easy to define:</p>\n\n<pre><code>class Post_model extends MY_Model\n{\n    public $belongs_to = array( 'author' );\n    public $has_many = array( 'comments' );\n[}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>More on github]<a href=\"https://github.com/jamierumbelow/codeigniter-base-model\" rel=\"nofollow\">1</a></p>",

    "body": "<p>iOS 7 is the seventh version of Apple's <a href=\"/questions/tagged/ios\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;ios&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">ios</a> mobile operating system and is the successor to <a href=\"/questions/tagged/ios6\" class=\"post-tag\" title=\"show questions tagged &#39;ios6&#39;\" rel=\"tag\">ios6</a>. It was announced at the company's Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013, and was released on September 18, 2013. It includes a redesigned user interface and a number of changes to the operating system's functionality. The design of iOS 7's new elements was led by Jony Ive, Apple's Senior Vice President of Design.</p>\n\n<p>iOS 7 was unveiled during the opening keynote of the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10, 2013. Billed as the \"biggest change to iOS since the introduction of the iPhone\", the most noticeable change was an overhaul of the user interface. In a promotional video shown during the keynote, Ive described the update as \"bringing order to complexity\", highlighting features such as refined typography, new icons, translucency, layering, physics, and gyroscope-driven parallaxing as some of the major changes to the design. The design of both iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) noticeably depart from skeuomorphic elements such as green felt in Game Center, wood in Newsstand, and leather in Calendar, in favor of flatter graphic design. The UI itself is not flat, but rather a multi-plane 2.5D zooming user interface. In his segment of the iOS presentation, Federighi emphasized ten major feature additions and changes.</p>\n\n<p>The icons for iOS 7 were reportedly designed by Apple's marketing team, with them being told to design the apps around the color palette of the icons; straying from the usual design methodology of iOS. iOS 7 uses a similar color palette to that of the original Apple logo. It was also noted that Apple's website displayed different icons for several iOS 7 apps for a period of time, leading to speculation that the icons were already in the process of being changed as the design continues to develop.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Compatibility</strong></p>\n\n<p>iOS 7 supports the following devices:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPhone 5S</li>\n<li>iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, iPad Mini, iPad Mini 2, iPad Air</li>\n<li>Apple TV 2nd and 3rd generation</li>\n<li>iPod Touch 5th generation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>iOS 7 References</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/WhatsNewIniOS/Articles/iOS7.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's New in iOS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.appcoda.com/customize-navigation-status-bar-ios-7/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Customize navigation &amp; status bar in ios 7</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/releasenotes/General/RN-iOSSDK-7.0/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iOS 7 Release Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>iOS 7 Latest Version</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://support.apple.com/kb/DL1750\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">iOS 7.1.2</a></li>\n</ul>",

Moreover, <code>escape</code> encodes Unicode characters as <code>%u####</code>, while <code>encodeURIComponent</code> first converts them to the UTF8 character sequence, then it encodes the single bytes.

GAP is used in research and teaching for studying groups and their representations, rings, vector spaces, algebras, combinatorial structures, and more.</p>\n<p>If you want to ask a question in this category, please note that there are well-established support channels for GAP users such as <a href=\"https://www.gap-system.org/Contacts/Forum/forum.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GAP Forum and GAP Support</a> <em>which may be more suitable places</em> for such questions with a different (though possibly intersecting) audience, and with a different response rate (which may be faster or slower, dependently on your question). While there may be GAP users and some authors of GAP and/or its packages among the users of this Q&amp;A site, please do not assume that the question on GAP asked here will necessarily be noticed by them.</p>\n<p>It may also happen that your question is already answered in the <a href=\"https://www.gap-system.org/Faq/faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Frequently Asked Questions</a> section of the GAP website or in the GAP Forum (to search GAP Forum archives, <a href=\"https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/search.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">click here</a>), or under the <a href=\"https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/gap\">&quot;gap&quot; tag on the Mathematics Q&amp;A website</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, if you think that you have discovered a bug in the GAP system, the recommended way to report it is to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/gap-system/gap/issues\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GAP issue tracker on GitHub</a>.

In watching the CPU utilization when debugging in chrome I would see it use up to as much at 40% of all 4 cores of my processor. I tried everything to no avail. Finally I tried making the browser window of the page I was debugging as small as I could without losing any of the required view and miraculously it solved the problem. So now I keep my debugger window popped out in a separate window and make the window of the page I am debugging as small as I can and my debugging experience is very fast again. I have tested this over a period of weeks and it has held out. Hope this helps someone. </p>",

The logic is if a certain value was present in both files then $hash{matchline} == 2 because the value will be incremented in both the while loops. However if the line was present in only one of the files the value of $hash{matchline} == 1 since only one while loop will increment the value and not the other.</p> <p>Also Lajos Veres raises a very important point: if a certain word say Tom is present twice in the same file then the algorithm will fail.

It made sense to me via <a href= http://developer.android.com >developer.android.com</a> what a span was and that it's either mutable or not. It's a place to put fixed or editable text. I think API17 &amp;/or Android4.2 doesn't handle zero length spans well. After driving me insane for 4 days I bumped into the res/layout XML I have.</p> <p>Navigating the lazy way I did and going to the graphical XML properties pane on the right hand side of the workspace there's a <em>TextView</em> tab listed after you click and highlight your button in question. After promoting/expanding the TextView tab there's an <em>Input Type</em> entry at the bottom of that list. On the right hand side of that entry there are ellipses. Click on those. After promoting those ellipses it yields another list of stuff. Click 'None'. Lastly save the XML file.</p> <p>That was my solution. I hope it will work for you.</p>",

    "body": "<p>In my humble opinion D3.js is not suited very well for this kind of visualization. The visualization is just too complex to do a simple mapping from data to SVG (and that's what D3.js is mainly for: generating DOM (documents) from Data through concise mappings).</p> <p>You can work around those limitations by introducing more logic in between so that data is not directly being displayed but rather a model is being created some calculations are being done and then the result is transformed to SVG by D3. This is what <a href= https://github.com/cpettitt/dagre-d3 rel= nofollow >dagre</a> is trying to do and it works rather well. </p> <p>However your graph has some special constraints that are currently not supported by simpler implementations of the layout algorithm: In the last layer you get a fork-like rendering. In the decision -layer you assign constraints to the edges so that they leave at the left and right of the nodes you also constrain the decision nodes to be on the same layer.</p> <p>All of this information is not visible in the graph structure itself. Therefor you need to annotate that information into your model and tell the layout algorithm to honor these constraints. To the best of my knowledge only commercial graph drawing library implementations currently support these advanced layout features.</p> <p><a href= http://www.yworks.com/yfileshtml rel= nofollow >yFiles for HTML</a> is such a library: In <a href= http://live.yworks.com/yfiles-for-html/1.2/demos/databinding/demo.yfiles.binding.interactivegraphsource/index.html rel= nofollow >this demo</a> you can use the following JSON to get a result like this:</p> <p><img src= http://i.stack.imgur.com/H1NU1.png alt= Screenshot of image created with yFiles for HTML demo ></p> <p>Switch to the combobox entry at the top: 5 - Complex Objects + Edge Labels </p> <p>And modify the JSON in the Nodes Sources Edges Source and Node Template sections as follows:</p> <p>Nodes Source</p> <pre><code>{ 0:{'name':'Start'color:'green'} 1:{'name':'Read ABC'color:'yellow'} 2:{'name':'Is B&gt;C?'color:'green'} 3:{'name':'Is A&gt;B?'color:'green'} 4:{'name':'Is A&gt;C?'color:'green'} 5:{'name':'Print B'color:'green'} 6:{'name':'Print C'color:'green'} 7:{'name':'Print C'color:'green'} 8:{'name':'Print A'color:'green'} 9:{'name':'End'color:'red'} } </code></pre> <p>Edge Source</p> <pre><code>[ {from:'0' to:'1' label:''} {from:'1' to:'3' label:''} {from:'3' to:'2' label:'No'} {from:'3' to:'4' label:'Yes'} {from:'2' to:'5' label:'Yes'} {from:'2' to:'6' label:'No'} {from:'4' to:'7' label:'No'} {from:'4' to:'8' label:'Yes'} {from:'5' to:'9' label:''} {from:'6' to:'9' label:''} {from:'7' to:'9' label:''} {from:'8' to:'9' label:''} ] </code></pre> <p>Template</p> <pre><code>&lt;rect fill='{Binding color}' stroke='LightBlue' stroke-width='2' width='{TemplateBinding width}' height='{TemplateBinding height}'&gt;&lt;/rect&gt; &lt;text transform='translate(10 20)' data-content='{Binding name}' style='font-size:18px; font-family:Arial; fill:#000; text-anchor: left; dominant-baseline: central;'&gt;&lt;/text&gt; </code></pre> <p>Note that using a different kind of JSON is possible too (as the demo shows). I don't believe that the JSON format is going to be a problem in any way at all and as you can see you get a decent result but still the constraints I mentioned have not been considered and added to the JSON. Unfortunately adding these constraints cannot be done through the demo interface I'm using above right now but needs to be done by adding more code to the actual source code of the demo. You can see how these constraints work in another demo (though without the JSON) in <a href= http://live.yworks.com/demobrowser/index.html#Incremental-Hierarchic rel= nofollow >this interactive layout demo</a>.</p> <p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I work for the company that creates that library however on SO/SE I do not represent my employer.

I just ran that tutorial's game on my Windows 8 PC with no problems using Visual Studio 2010 and XNA 4 - so it works fine on Windows 8 as Microsoft still supports XNA 4 on the Windows 8 desktop (just not for Windows Store apps).

    "body": "<p>There are several concerns in your code but let me try to wrap them up: </p> <h2>Controller</h2> <p>How is the controller called? As you paginate through stores I assume it is the <code>StoresController</code>. In <em>Rails Way</em> we would expect a <code>StoresController</code> to perform actions on <code>Stores</code> models. </p> <p>Also in a more <em>RESTful</em> way you would probably not define a function <code>near</code> but rather a function <code>index</code> which lists all <code>Stores</code> and this list can be sorted by providing the <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> params.</p> <h2>Models</h2> <p>It is unclear to me why you do <code>Store.find_by_id(bank[ id ])</code>. In normal scenarios such a call makes no sense as a <code>bank_id</code> only <em>identifies</em> a <code>Bank</code> and not a <code>Store</code>. So I assume you are looking for some relations between <code>Bank</code> and <code>Store</code> model which you would achieve by adding a <code>bank_id</code> field to your <code>stores</code> Table and define the <code>Store</code> model as: </p> <pre><code>class Store &lt; ActiveRecord:Base belongs_to :bank end </code></pre> <h2>Query</h2> <p>As previous answeres claimed you would better go with so called <em>scopes</em> to put your query into the model and not the controller. But for your specific usecase I would recommend to have a look at the <a href= https://github.com/geokit/geokit-rails rel= nofollow >geokit-rails gem</a> which would allow you to do something like:</p> <pre><code>Store.by_distance(origin: [params[:lat]params[:lng]]) </code></pre> <p>In order to use it you have to define your <code>Store</code> model to <code>acts_as_mappable</code> like this:</p> <pre><code>class Store &lt; ActiveRecord:Base acts_as_mappable :through =&gt; :bank end </code></pre> <p>And of course you need the <code>lat</code> and <code>lng</code> fields defined in your <code>banks</code> table.</p> <p>(Unfortunately the README of the geokit-rails gem is way out of date so you have to fiddle a bit to get it right)</p> <h2>pagination</h2> <p>I think it is an error to write </p> <p>@user = @stores.paginate(:page => params[:page] :per_page => 10 )</p> <p>With above query code you should instead write</p> <p>@stores = Store.by_distance(origin: [params[:lat]params[:lng]]).paginate(page: params[:page] per_page: 10)</p> <h2>Error handling</h2> <p>It is unlikely that you will get an ActiveRecord::NotFound Exception as these are usually only thrown when you use <code>find</code>-lookups on specific <code>id</code>. When you want to throw such an exception you would to something like:</p> <pre><code>raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound if @stores.empty? </code></pre> <p>at the bottom of your method.</p>",

There was no any documentation for request syntax.</p> <p>After 2 hrs of research I finally dug something out. First thing to know there are 3 types of request mode:</p> <p><strong>1. Implicit mode</strong></p> <p>JSON query use non empty value i.e json=1 .Examples:</p> <ul> <li><a href= http://www.example.com/?json=1 rel= nofollow >http://www.example.com/?json=1</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.example.com/?p=47&amp;json=1 rel= nofollow >http://www.example.com/?p=47&amp;json=1</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.example.com/tag/banana/?json=1 rel= nofollow >http://www.example.com/tag/banana/?json=1</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>2. Explicit mode</strong></p> <p>JSON query use known string value i.e json=get_recent_post .Examples:</p> <ul> <li><a href= http://www.example.org/?json=get_recent_posts rel= nofollow >http://www.example.org/?json=get_recent_posts</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.example.org/?json=get_post&amp;post_id=47 rel= nofollow >http://www.example.org/?json=get_post&amp;post_id=47</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.example.org/?json=get_tag_posts&amp;tag_slug=banana rel= nofollow >http://www.example.org/?json=get_tag_posts&amp;tag_slug=banana</a></li> </ul> <p><strong>3. Permalink mode</strong></p> <p>No JSON query but user friendly permalinks are used for request i.e /api/get_recent_post .Examples:</p> <ul> <li><a href= http://www.example.org/api/get_recent_posts/ rel= nofollow >http://www.example.org/api/get_recent_posts/</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.example.org/api/get_post/?post_id=47 rel= nofollow >http://www.example.org/api/get_post/?post_id=47</a></li> <li><a href= http://www.example.org/api/get_tag_posts/?tag_slug=banana rel= nofollow >http://www.example.org/api/get_tag_posts/?tag_slug=banana</a></li> </ul> <p>Also syntax for listing category is:</p> <p><strong><a href= http://blog.example.com/?json=get_category_index rel= nofollow >http://blog.example.com/?json=get_category_index</a></strong></p> <p>Also other important basic request are:</p> <ol> <li><strong><a href= http://blog.example.com/?json=get_tag_index rel= nofollow >http://blog.example.com/?json=get_tag_index</a></strong>(To get list of Tag)</li> <li><strong><a href= http://blog.example.com/?json=get_author_index rel= nofollow >http://blog.example.com/?json=get_author_index</a></strong>(To get list of Author)</li> <li><strong><a href= http://blog.example.com/?json=get_page_index rel= nofollow >http://blog.example.com/?json=get_page_index</a></strong>(To get list of Page)</li> <li><strong><a href= http://blog.example.com/?json=get_date_index rel= nofollow >http://blog.example.com/?json=get_date_index</a></strong>(To get list of Date)</li> </ol> <p>More details can be found in this <a href= https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/other_notes/ rel= nofollow >link</a>.

PLay 2 is even more amazing than previous one. I'd like to learn Scala so it's perfect for me but also because of that it's not GAE compatible anymore but come on there are other ways to deploy apps I'd like to try OpenShift (dunno if it's possible I'll try it soon).</p> <p>I'm also a big fan of Python so it's naturally that I'm also looking for frameworks to build apps in that. I would say that Django isn't the only choice. I had few tries with Django right now I'm trying web2py. As many stated Django has quite hard learning curve. Web2py should be better but I don't like the 'wizzard' way of scaffolding apps.</p> <p>I've used Bottle (Flask is similar) and it's great for small apps. RESTful apps are super-easy with them so maybe it should be your starting point.</p> <p>From what I've read about Python's frameworks:</p> <ul> <li>Django is quite good for typical websites/CMS-like hard to learn</li> <li>web2py very interesting --- I'm in the middle of testing that Reddit's using it?</li> <li>web.py -- minimalistic lightweight framework you have to build webapp almost from scratch</li> <li>Tornado/Twisted --- fast async frameworks</li> <li>Flask/Bottle --- very nice microframeworks. Great for REST services</li> </ul> <p>I've not tried them all but it's what I've found out during reading the web/blogs etc.</p> <p>I'm looking for something like Play Framework 2.x but in Python(ideally 3) :)</p>",

    "body": "<p>This depends on almost about anything and you don't say much about your server side.</p> <p>But you must balance on what you compute before and what you compute now. The before takes space and saves time the now takes time and saves space. Do you have fast I/O (hdd/ssd/raid X) ? Do you have much space? Do you have powerful cpus? Does your server handle great bandwith? Why each tile should have <strong>1000</strong> records? What are the most popular zoom levels?</p> <p>First of all you must start from somewhere. Your tiniest data is the minute. So you must have details about minutes. This releaves you from holding miliseconds. From my experience a file with a range of id's is essential like a <code>23211239-23242175.csv</code> file. So that tile is your start. The id I got is the <code>miliseconds/1000/60</code> to become minutes. I see your data has time-range and that is a small problem. Every record should fill entirely into your timeframe it's like you should care only about <code>timeEnd</code> and put the record in that time-frame.</p> <p>To have good I/O check your file to be close to a multiple of the cluster size of your disks. For windows I think it is <strong>4kb</strong>. The cluster size is the size that is brought back by the disk in one I/O let's say you have 2 csv's that are <strong>6kb</strong> each. It would require 2 I/O's to bring each file to the memory so you got <strong>4 I/O's</strong> to bring <strong>2x6Kb</strong> files. But if you split these into 3 of 4kb each it would require <strong>3 I/O's</strong> to load them into memory. So check if these tiles are really close to cluster size.</p> <p>See if you can get rid of some fields like <code>timeStarttimeEndtimeDuration</code> because your filename will describe these fields. Try to precompute as much data as you can to save proccessing time. From your details on zoom's levels each level is computed by the previous level. Try to create subfolders that go through the next levels. You don't have to compute every zoom level try to skip some it will save space. Then upon requests you will find what users are most asking for and create it if it does not exist. Have folders like:</p> <pre><code>Path/1m/xxxxxxxx-xxxxxxx.csv Path/30m/xxxxxxx-xxxxxx.csv Path/6h/xxxxx-xxxxx.csv Path/w/xx-xx.csv </code></pre> <p>Be sure you only have the <strong>1 minute</strong> file at start and then create the others. I bet that when you zoom into a level like for <strong>2014</strong> it will show <strong>2014's</strong> months. So it is like you need at most X results for each chart. So maybe your tiles won't have the same lenth at each zoom level/folder. It depends on what they describe. Then it will be easy for you to find anything just check the range the file describes and return it. Popular resolutions can be cached into memory for a period of time to make even faster the output proccess.</p> <p>On the client side you should try to keep as much data as you can. Don't ask server for data that you have previously got again. The problem with RAM caching files is that the file can be outdated so be careful. If you watch results of past year (year is said because it is the most generic resolution level in this application) you should know that newcomers won't affect these old fields so you can cache them safely.</p> <p>This problem does not lie only on client side programming. To make a robust and efficient chart app you should have a great backend logic to accomplish it. I had to tell these even if I don't see any server tags (rornodejsphp) in this question...</p>",

Next create a service which consumes <code>IXmlTranslator</code>s:</p> <pre><code>[Export] public class XmlTranslatorService { private readonly IEnumerable&lt;Lazy&lt;IXmlTranslator INamedMetadata&gt;&gt; _translators; [ImportingConstructor] public XmlTranslatorService(IEnumerable&lt;Lazy&lt;IXmlTranslator INamedMetadata&gt;&gt; translators) { _translators = translators; } public XmlModel Translate(string name XElement element) { var translator = GetTranslator(name); if (translator == null) throw new ArgumentException( No translator is available to translate the target xml. ); return translator.Translate(element); } private IXmlTranslator GetTranslator(string name) { var translator = _translators .Where(t =&gt; t.Metadata.Name.Equals(name StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)) .Select(t =&gt; t.Value) .FirstOrDefault(); return translator; } } </code></pre> <p>I've made the enumerable of available translators part of the constructor arguments as it defines dependencies that are required for the service to work. MEF will take care of injecting this enumerable at composition time.</p> <p>What you need to do is either <code>Import</code> an instance of the <code>XmlTranslatorService</code> into whatever class you want to use it from or you can initialise an instance directly from your <code>CompositionContainer</code> e.g.:</p> <pre><code>var service = container.GetExportedValue&lt;XmlTranslatorService&gt;(); </code></pre> <p>The only thing remaining would be</p> <ol> <li>Creating specialised translators for each of the hotel types into the common <code>XmlModel</code> model class.</li> <li>Serialisation of the <code>XmlModel</code> class into the target xml.</li> </ol> <p>Hope that points you in the right direction?</p>",

An app with gps support gets the latest coordinates returned from this libgps.so which is actually loaded dynamically by the GpsLocationProvider service.</p></li> <li><p>Create one more shared object using Vbox headers and containing routines to connect disconnect and send function request to the <code>host service</code> running in host OS. These are simple ioctl calls with pre-defined ioctl-numbers (eg: VBOX_GUEST_IOCTL_HGCM_CONNECT etc).</p></li> <li><p>Create a host service (which actually is a DLL loaded by <code>VBox Host Service</code>) with can handle the parameters passed from HGCM calls and return the required data in a format that the shared object created in step 2 understands.</p></li> <li><p>Now to send any fake/dummy location back to an app running inside <code>Android VM</code> you just need to notify the <code>host service</code> and the rest is communicated back to <code>VBox Additions</code> -> <code>libgps.so</code> -> <code>GpsLocationProvider service</code> -> and finally to the <code>App with GPS Support</code>.</p></li> </ol> <p>Hope this will help some one trying some thing similar or help some one understanding how android stack works.</p> <p>NOTE: Compiling the hgcm code and linking it with android lib is also a bit complicated because of the limited number of functions implemented in android libc (and some other libs as well). To avoid this all you can directly open the device (/dev/vboxguest) and issue ioctl calls on it in the format that is known to vbox and your host service.</p>",

Thanks!</p> <p>After playing with it for a bit I realized that the <code>JavaScriptSerializer</code> step is unnecessary since <code>PostAsJsonAsync</code> automatically serializes whatever object you pass to it. The double serialization prevents Marketo's API from processing the input.</p> <p>Also I agree with Jep that Postman is super helpful. But in the case of this error Postman was working fine (using the contents of <code>inputJsonString</code>) but my C# code still didn't work properly. So I temporarily modified the code to return a <code>dynamic</code> object instead of a <code>CreateLeadResponseResult</code>. In debugging mode this allowed me to see fields that were discarded because they didn't fit the <code>CreateLeadResponseResult</code> type which led me to the solution above.</p>",

Think about this: does the following query raise an error just because no row was updated?</p> <pre><code>CREATE TABLE #foo(a INT); UPDATE #foo SET a = 1 WHERE a = 2; </code></pre> <p>There is no error message here so no reason for <code>CATCH</code> to be triggered. If you want to test your error handling put a <em>real</em> error condition in there. For example:</p> <pre><code>BEGIN TRY IF @force_error = 1 BEGIN SELECT 1/0; END END TRY BEGIN CATCH -- now you should get here... END CATCH </code></pre> <p>Also as I mentioned in a comment - use <code>RETURN</code> to send error number / status code back to the caller.

    "body": "<p>Your question is not related to the structures but to the way C evaluates expressions. You have <code>ptr</code> which is a pointer to some memory location that stores a structure. Basically is the address of a memory location (an integer value). Then you have 2 pointers Head and Current which are global pointers to a structure of the same type as ptr and you want to make them point to the same structure as ptr. Basically what you want is to allocate memory for the new structure which is referenced by ptr and make Head and Current point to the same memory location. Thus you want the following assignments:</p> <pre><code>Head = ptr; Current = ptr; </code></pre> <p>You can contract those 2 expressions in one:</p> <pre><code>Head = Current = ptr; </code></pre> <p> which is evaluated as:</p> <pre><code>(Head = (Current = ptr)); </code></pre> <p>So ptr is first assigned to Current then the value of that assignment (which is ptr) is assigned to Head. And now you have a Head which is the beginning of the linked list and a Current pointer which may be used for iteration and has an initial value equal to Head.</p>",

If so HDF5 is an excellent option to use as a storage container. </p> <p>For example let's create an array and save it to an HDF file with some metadata using <code>h5py</code>:</p> <pre><code>import numpy as np import h5py some_data = np.random.random((100 100)) with h5py.File('data.hdf' 'w') as outfile: dataset = outfile.create_dataset('my data' data=some_data) dataset.attrs['an arbitrary key'] = 'arbitrary values' dataset.attrs['foo'] = 10.2 </code></pre> <p>We can then read it back in:</p> <pre><code>import h5py with h5py.File('data.hdf' 'r') as infile: dataset = infile['my data'] some_data = dataset[...] # Load it into memory. Could also slice a subset. print dataset.attrs['an arbitrary key'] print dataset.attrs['foo'] </code></pre> <p>As others have mentioned if you are only concerned with storing the data + metadata in memory a better option is a <code>dict</code> or simple wrapper class. For example:</p> <pre><code>class Container: def __init__(self data **kwargs): self.data = data self.metadata = kwargs </code></pre> <p>Of course this won't behave like a numpy array directly but it's usually a bad idea to subclass <code>ndarrays</code>. (You can but it's easy to do incorrectly. You're almost always better off designing a class that stores the array as an attribute.)</p> <p>Better yet make any operations you're doing methods of a similar class to the example above. For example:</p> <pre><code>import scipy.signal import numpy as np class SeismicCube(object): def __init__(self data bounds metadata=None): self.data = data self.x0 self.x1 self.y0 self.y1 self.z0 self.z1= bounds self.bounds = bounds self.metadata = {} if metadata is None else metadata def inside(self x y z): Test if a point is inside the cube. inx = self.x0 &gt;= x &gt;= self.x1 iny = self.y0 &gt;= y &gt;= self.y1 inz = self.z0 &gt;= z &gt;= self.z1 return inx and iny and inz def inst_amp(self): Calculate instantaneous amplitude and return a new SeismicCube. hilb = scipy.signal.hilbert(self.data axis=2) data = np.hypot(hilb.real hilb.imag) return type(self)(data self.bounds self.metadata) </code></pre>",

    "body": "<p>The typical way to do this is to add another record (MIME type NFC Forum external type or URI) to the tag in addition to the Android Application Record (AAR). In that case the AAR must be the last (or at least not the first) record of the NDEF message on the tag.</p> <p>You can then catch the tag discovery by filtering for that specific data type (i.e. the type of the <strong>first record</strong> of the NDEF message on your tag) using the <code>NDEF_DISCOVERED</code> intent filter. E.g. for an NFC Forum external type:</p> <pre><code>&lt;activity android:name= .MainActivity &gt; &lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name= android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED /&gt; &lt;category android:name= android.intent.category.DEFAULT /&gt; &lt;data android:scheme= vnd.android.nfc android:host= ext android:pathPrefix= /yourdomain.com:yourtypename /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; &lt;/activity&gt; </code></pre> <p>In that case the AAR will make sure that your app gets precedence over any other apps that registered for the same type and that Play Store is opend for your app if it's not already installed.</p> <p>If you do not register any activity for a matching <code>NDEF_DISCOVERED</code> intent filter the AAR will cause the first activity that has a <code>MAIN</code>/<code>LAUNCHER</code> intent filter (in that case Android won't pass a handle to the tag to your activity though). Hence if you neither register for <code>NDEF_DISCOVERED</code> intents nor for <code>MAIN</code>/<code>LAUNCHER</code> intents the AAR mechanism won't work.</p> <p><strong>But what if you want your tag to <em>only</em> contain an AAR and no other records?</strong></p> <p>You could do this by registering an intent filter for the AAR itself. The AAR is an NFC Forum external type with the type name urn:nfc:ext:<strong>android.com:pkg</strong>  so you could use the following intent filter:</p> <pre><code>&lt;intent-filter&gt; &lt;action android:name= android.nfc.action.NDEF_DISCOVERED /&gt; &lt;category android:name= android.intent.category.DEFAULT /&gt; &lt;data android:scheme= vnd.android.nfc android:host= ext android:pathPrefix= /android.com:pkg /&gt; &lt;/intent-filter&gt; </code></pre>",

No it isn't! It's just a method like any other method taking a block that's just like any other block.

Malicious or unintentional use of the <code>synchronized</code> keyword while locking on your object's reference can cause your class to behave poorly under concurrent usage as an external class can effectively block your <code>this</code>-synchronized methods and there is nothing you can do (in your class) to prohibit this at runtime. To avoid this potential pitfall you would synchronize on a <code>private final Object</code> or use the <code>Lock</code> interface in <code>java.util.concurrent.locks</code>.</p> <p>For this simple example you could alternately use an <code>AtomicInteger</code> rather than synchronizing the setter/getter.</p>",

For example I'm assuming you ran tar on the tarball before you ran configure or make? Also little concerned when you say you ran configure and THEN navigated to the 24.5 directory? You should be running make install from the same directory/folder where you ran configure. You also didn't indicate you had run make bootstrap.</p> <p>The steps should be</p> <ul> <li>scp emacs-24.5.tar.gz user@remote-host:~</li> <li>ssh user@remote-host</li> <li>tar xzf emacs-24.5.tar.gz</li> <li>cd emacs-24.5</li> <li>./configure</li> <li>make bootstrap</li> <li>sudo make install</li> <li>Notice in the output from the make install there are directions on an additional command you need to run to set movemail permissions. This command also needs to be run under sudo</li> </ul> <p>I'm assuming your not ssh'ing intot the remote host as root as this would be a bad practice. This means that when you do the make install you need to run the process with root privileges so you need to use sudo. </p> <p>You should also check the output from configure and make sure there are no errors. Configure will also list emacs features which are turned on/off depending on whether you have various supporting libraries installed. If you scroll the terminal output from configure up a couple of pages you will see the printout. If there are features listed with a 'no' which you want/expect you will need to go through the documentation and work out which additional supporting libraries you need. However most of the time with modern linux distros setup for desktop use everything will likely already be there. Might be different on a server and I can't speak about Windows and what it might require.</p>",

    "body": "<p>The code you already have covers the <em>general</em> functionality that you need which is to set the value of a button to a particular string.</p> <p>The expansion that you're looking at is a matter of changing the value of this string to one of three values. First step might be to look at how you would be able to change a value more than one (not necessarily wrapping). This could be done in a straightforward manner with an array something like the following:</p> <pre><code>var labels = [ Initial  Value has changed  Value changed again ]; var index = 0; function valChange() { index++; document.myForm.myButton.value = labels[index]; } </code></pre> <p>That's great for up to two clicks but it breaks beyond that because you go past the end of the array. The trick to get the full looping pattern then is to <em>reset</em> the counter to zero once it goes past the end effectively making your array circular:</p> <pre><code>function valChange() { index++; if (index == labels.length) { index = 0; } document.myForm.myButton.value = labels[index]; } </code></pre> <p>And voila! Every time the <code>valChange</code> function is called the index is incremented so the <em>next</em> label will be different and it handles the circularity constraint as required.</p> <p>Note that this implementation doesn't <em>strictly</em> look at what the label's current value is; rather it maintains its own version of this state via the <code>index</code> counter. This is arguably simpler and cleaner if you know that this method will be the only way that the label can be modified. However if the label might arbitrarily be changed to a different value by external code you might want to work out the index on the fly by getting the button's current label and comparing it to each array element in turn. This is slower a little clumsier but more robust in the face of external modifications.</p>",

It handles the delete key as well as arrow key navigation.

    "body": "<p>The partition summary is a sampling of the partition index. The partition summary is an in-memory structure that reduces the amount of scan time required to find a partition key within the index.</p> <p>A very simple example will help explain the concept.</p> <p>Assume the partition index file has 100 partition keys in it: pk001 to pk100. The partition keys are stored in sorted order so we know that pk027 comes after pk025. </p> <p>In this over simplified example if the partition summary were set to sample every 10 partition keys then it would contain a map to ten partition keys and their location on disk within the partition index. For example pk001 -> beginning of file pk010 -> location of pk010 in the index file and so on.</p> <p>Now when C* gets a request for pk027 it knows that pk027 is located after pk020. Also the summary (which samples every 10 partition keys) knows the exact location of pk020. </p> <p>So C* does a seek to the location of pk020 within the index file based on the information provided by the summary. It then performs a very short scan from pk020 to pk027.</p> <p>In summary the partition summary is an in-memory sampling of the partition index file that allows Cassandra to perform a seek the approximate location of a partition within the index file followed by a very short scan.</p>",

If the <code>doLotsOfWork()</code> method takes a noticeable amount of time to execute (e.g. >100ms) the user will notice the browser hiccup due to the single-threaded nature of JavaScript execution.</p> <p>Instead consider using an <a href= http://google-web-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/2.1/com/google/gwt/core/client/Scheduler.html#scheduleIncremental%28com.google.gwt.core.client.Scheduler.RepeatingCommand%29 rel= nofollow >incrementally-scheduled command</a> to break the work up. It would look roughly like:</p> <pre><code>void onSuccess(Value v) { showProgressBar(); Scheduler.get().scheduleIncremental(new RepeatingCommand() { int count = 0; int size = v.getElements().size(); public boolean execute() { if (count == size) { hideProgressBar(); return false; } processOneElement(v.getElements().get(count++)); setProgressBar((double) count / size); return true; } }); } </code></pre> <p>By breaking the work across multiple pumps of the browser's event loop you avoid the situation where the webapp becomes non-responsive if there's a non-trivial amount of work to do.</p>",

Personally I think this will be your best bet because the VBA code can be focused on just loading up the file rather than connecting to Unix and getting the file too.</p> <p>3) If you have a Samba share set up on your Unix server for a directory then you'll be able to see that directory from Windows and can just go there to get the file. </p> <p>Once you have the file on your Windows computer you can open Excel and load the file like this:</p> <pre><code>Set xl = CreateObject( Excel.Application ) xl.Visible = True Set wb = xl.Workbooks.Open( c:\\name.csv ) </code></pre>",

If you're bottlenecked on decode this won't help you; if you're bottlenecked on upload time expect it to cause no more than a 33% speedup.</p> <p>If you're currently using a JPEG for the texture you don't have an alpha channel to worry about. Depending on your quality needs using an ETC1- (or device-specific compression -- PVRTC is quite nice if you're on a PVR GPU) compressed texture will have a massively larger improvement in both upload time and decode time.</p>",

A short summary of the steps I used on Ubuntu 12.04 is replicated here:</p> <p>Install mod_ruby for apache:</p> <pre><code>sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-ruby </code></pre> <p>To enable mod_ruby for all files under /var/www edit your apache config file i.e. <code>/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default</code></p> <p>I had to add <code>+ExecCGI</code> to <code>Options</code> and add the section pertaining to Ruby:</p> <pre><code>&lt;Directory /var/www/&gt; Options Indexes +ExecCGI # Ruby with mod_ruby RubyRequire apache/ruby-run &lt;Files *.rb&gt; SetHandler ruby-object RubyHandler Apache::RubyRun.instance AddType text/html rb &lt;/Files&gt; &lt;/Directory&gt; </code></pre> <p>The main drawback that I see is that I can't seem to find a way to set the mime/content type from within the script. You have to set it globally for all ruby scripts with the <code>AddType text/html rb</code> directive.</p> <p>Finally you need a test script in /var/www and it must be executable. For example I have <code>/var/www/test.rb</code>:</p> <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/ruby puts Hello World!&lt;br&gt;&lt;pre&gt; ENV.each { |kv| puts #{k}=#{v} } puts &lt;/pre&gt; </code></pre> <p>Don't forget to make it executable:</p> <pre><code>chmod a+x /var/www/test.rb </code></pre> <p>And this outputs:</p> <pre><code>Hello World!

Their data is more reliable and timely but obviously you need an account and they have to offer some kind of API. Check into something like InteractiveBrokers.com. They are mostly java centric but offer a Window's based C++ DLL as well. Several other brokers offer similar APIs but IB is excellent in that it covers a multitude of exchanges including I believe London. They also make it relatively easy to transfer currencies if that is a concern.</p> <p>Lastly you have to go to commercial brokers. You can find them easily enough with a search but be prepared to pay a couple of hundred dollars per month minimum.</p> <p>I think Mark's suggestion of QT is a good way to go for a GUI.

So you could simply change the in <code>didSelectRowAtIndexPath</code> method and change back to original color in <code>didDeselectRowAtIndexPath</code> method. Also you could use highlight option for showing selected cell with <code>cell.selectionStyle</code>. Also one thing that don't need to to call <code>didDeselectRowAtIndexPath</code> method simple in <code>didSelectRowAtIndexPath</code> u could change color and push or present your second view controller and just before pushing or presenting just change color of cell back to original color.</p>",
