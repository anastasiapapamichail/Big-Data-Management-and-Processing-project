  <p>The Spring Framework supports
  integration with Hibernate, Java
  Persistence API (JPA), Java Data
  Objects (JDO) and iBATIS SQL Maps for
  resource management, data access
  object (DAO) implementations, and
  transaction strategies. For example,
  for Hibernate there is first-class
  support with several convenient IoC
  features that address many typical
  Hibernate integration issues. You can
  configure all of the supported
  features for O/R (object relational)
  mapping tools through Dependency
  Injection. They can participate in
  Spring's resource and transaction
  management, and they comply with
  Spring's generic transaction and DAO
  exception hierarchies. The recommended
  integration style is to code DAOs
  against plain Hibernate, JPA, and JDO
  APIs. The older style of using
  Spring's DAO templates is no longer
  recommended; however, coverage of this
  style can be found in the Section A.1,
  <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/classic-spring.html#classic-spring-orm"" rel=""nofollow"">“Classic ORM usage”</a> in the
  appendices.</p>
  
  <p>Spring adds significant enhancements
  to the ORM layer of your choice when
  you create data access applications.
  You can leverage as much of the
  integration support as you wish, and
  you should compare this integration
  effort with the cost and risk of
  building a similar infrastructure
  in-house. You can use much of the ORM
  support as you would a library,
  regardless of technology, because
  everything is designed as a set of
  reusable JavaBeans. ORM in a Spring
  IoC container facilitates
  configuration and deployment. Thus
  most examples in this section show
  configuration inside a Spring
  container.</p>

<p>Rails is a framework built on Ruby that provides developers and easy way to build an full-featured application. It is popular among many developers from novices to experiences developers working for large corporations. In short, it utilizes <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93View%E2%80%93Controller"" rel=""nofollow"">MVC fundamentals</a> and lives by the phrase 'convention over configuration' (CoC) and 'don't repeat yourself' (DRY). </p>

<hr>

<h2>Rails 3</h2>

<p>Rails 3 is the most recent version of the Rails framework and provides a few upgrades and differences from its predecessors:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brand new router with an emphasis on RESTful declarations</li>
<li>New Action Mailer API modeled after Action Controller</li>
<li>New Active Record chainable query language built on top of relational algebra</li>
<li>Unobtrusive JavaScript helpers with drivers for Prototype and jQuery</li>
<li>Explicit dependency management with Bundler</li>
</ul>

<p>These are cited from the <a href=""http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Rails 3 release notes</a>. Some other new features include a better console environment. You can now start the rails server, console, etc using the alias <code>rails</code>:</p>

<pre><code>rails s          #starts rails server
rails server     #starts rails server
rails c          #starts rails console
rails console    #starts rails console
</code></pre>

<p>For more information on changes, see the [Rails 3 release notes].<a href=""http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">2</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Caveats</h2>

<p>This is such a huge topic that it's actually worth mentioning in this wiki. All too often, Rails is compared to another popular web-founded programming language - <a href=""http://php.net"" rel=""nofollow"">PHP</a>. Despite what you may hear, there is no competition between PHP and Rails.</p>

<p>Furthermore, PHP is often directly compared to Rails in terms of efficiency, usability, scalability, etc. This is an entirely unfair comparison. Rails (actually Ruby on Rails) is a <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework"" rel=""nofollow"">framework</a></strong> built on Ruby. If you read an article comparing Rails and PHP, the article is unfounded. </p>

<p>To adequately compare the two languages, one must either:</p>

<ul>
<li>compare PHP and Ruby</li>
<li>compare Rails and a PHP framework like <a href=""http://codeigniter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CodeIgniter</a> or <a href=""http://cakephp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">CakePHP</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Please keep this is mind in literature you come across in your development.</p>

It is a .NET code library that allows you to parse ""out of the web"" HTML files. The parser is very tolerant with ""real world"" malformed HTML. The object model is very similar to what proposes System.Xml, but for HTML documents (or streams).</p>

<p>Html Agility Pack now supports Linq to Objects (via a LINQ to Xml Like interface).</p>

<p>Sample applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page fixing or generation. You can fix a page the way you want, modify the DOM, add nodes, copy nodes, well... you name it.</li>
<li>Web scanners. You can easily get to img/src or a/hrefs with a bunch XPATH queries.</li>
<li>Web scrapers. You can easily scrap any existing web page into an RSS feed for example, with just an XSLT file serving as the binding. Examples are is provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no dependency on anything else than .Net's XPATH implementation. There is no dependency on Internet Explorer's MSHTML dll or W3C's HTML tidy or ActiveX / COM object, or anything like that. There is also no adherence to XHTML or XML, although you can actually produce XML using the tool.</p>
